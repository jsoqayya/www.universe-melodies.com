        <h1>Chapter Four<br>The Prostration of the Universe</h1>

        <div class="box box-desc">
            <span class="box-title">Description</span>
            <p>This chapter deals with the concept of the prostration of the universe and all its components to God, based on Qur'anic and Hadith evidence. The chapter explains that prostration includes all sane and non-sane creatures, and that every atom, every animal, every plant, every planet, and every star prostrates to God in its own way. The chapter links religious texts with modern scientific data on the behavior of non-sentient beings such as plants and the movement of mountains, emphasizing that prostration and reverence is a realistic concept that reflects the regularity of the cosmic system and its submission to God. The chapter aims to deepen the religious and educational understanding of the concept of prostration and reverence, and to motivate the reader to inspire humility, humiliation, and submission in his worship and daily life by contemplating the manifestations of cosmic submission to God. The chapter concludes by emphasizing that this understanding generates many religious and educational effects, such as glorifying God, reverence in prayer, and humility in dealing with the universe and life.</p>

        <h2>The Concept of Cosmic Prostration</h2>
        <p>Prostration in language means humility, submission, and bowing. In Islamic terminology, it means placing the forehead on the ground in glorification of God Almighty. But cosmic prostration has a broader and more comprehensive meaning, as it includes the submission of every atom in the universe to the will of God and its submission to His laws.</p>
        <p>Cosmic prostration is not just a physical movement, but a state of existence in which the creature is fully directed towards its Creator, acknowledging His oneness and divinity. It is the ultimate expression of servitude, where the creature is stripped of all claims of power and might, and recognizes its absolute need for God.</p>
        <p>The entire universe, in its tangible and intangible parts, is in a state of constant prostration to God. This prostration manifests itself in various forms appropriate to the nature of each creature.</p>
        <p>The angels prostrate, the sun prostrates, the moon prostrates, the stars prostrate, the mountains prostrate, the trees prostrate, the animals prostrate, and the believers among the humans and the jinn prostrate.</p>
        
        <div class="box box-verse">
            <span class="box-title">Verse</span>
            <span class="verse-text">"Haven't you seen that to Allah prostrates whoever is in the heavens and whoever is in the earth, the sun, the moon, the stars, the mountains, the trees, the beasts, and many of the people, and many upon whom the punishment is due? And whoever Allah humiliates, there is no one to honor him. Indeed, Allah does what He wills."</span>
            <span class="verse-ref">[Al-Hajj: 18]</span>
        </div>

        <p>This noble verse paints a majestic scene of the universe in a state of collective prostration, where all creatures, high and low, sane and insane, participate in this great cosmic ritual. Only the disobedient among the people who chose to deviate from the cosmic consensus and break away from the circle of servitude deviate from this general rule.</p>

        <h2>First research: Qur'anic Evidence of Prostration</h2>
        <p>The Holy Qur'an is replete with verses that confirm the fact that the universe prostrates to God. These verses are not merely metaphors, but express a realistic cosmic truth that we may not perceive with our limited senses.</p>
        
        <div class="box box-verse">
            <span class="box-title">Verse</span>
            <span class="verse-text">"And to Allah prostrates whoever is in the heavens and the earth, willingly and unwillingly, and their shadows in the morning and the afternoon."</span>
            <span class="verse-ref">[Al-Ra'd: 15]</span>
        </div>
        <p>This verse indicates that prostration includes all rational beings in the heavens and the earth (angels, humans, jinn), whether they prostrate by choice (the believers) or by compulsion (the disbelievers). It also refers to the prostration of shadows, which is a physical manifestation of the submission of material objects to God's laws.</p>

        <div class="box box-verse">
            <span class="box-title">Verse</span>
            <span class="verse-text">"And the star and the tree prostrate."</span>
            <span class="verse-ref">[Al-Rahman: 6]</span>
        </div>
        <p>Here, the Qur'an specifically mentions the prostration of plants (the star: plants without stems, and the tree: plants with stems), confirming that the plant world is also part of the prostrating system.</p>

        <div class="box box-verse">
            <span class="box-title">Verse</span>
            <span class="verse-text">"Have they not considered what things Allah has created? Their shadows incline to the right and to the left, prostrating to Allah, while they are humble."</span>
            <span class="verse-ref">[Al-Nahl: 48]</span>
        </div>
        <p>This verse invites us to contemplate the shadows of things as they move and shift, considering this movement a form of prostration to God and humiliation to His majesty.</p>

        <div class="box box-note">
            <span class="box-title">Ibn Kathir's Interpretation</span>
            <p><strong>Ibn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) says in his interpretation of the verse of Al-Hajj:</strong> "He tells us that He alone is the One to be worshipped, and that everything prostrates to His might, and everything is humbled to His majesty and greatness, and everything is subject to His command, and everything is subservient to His will, the angels, the celestial bodies, the earthly animals, the inanimate objects and the plants."</p>
        </div>

        <div class="box box-note">
            <span class="box-title">Al-Tabari's Interpretation</span>
            <p><strong>Al-Tabari says in his interpretation of the verse of Al-Nahl:</strong> "He says, exalted is His mention: 'Did these polytheists who deny the oneness of God not look at the things God has created, such as trees, mountains, and other objects, that have shadows that they cast when the sun rises and when it sets?'... 'Prostrating to God,' he says: Their shadows seek God by adhering to the earth, and I described them as prostrating because of their adherence to the earth, just as the prostrator adheres his forehead to the earth."</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Research II: Manifestations of the prostration of creatures</h2>
        <p>The Qur'an details the manifestations of the prostration of various creatures, giving us a clearer picture of how this cosmic worship is performed.</p>

        <h3>I: The prostration of the shadows</h3>
        <p>Shadows are not just optical phenomena, but signs of the submission of objects to God's laws. The shifting of shadows to the right and left with the movement of the sun is considered in the Qur'anic perspective a prostration to God.</p>
        <p><strong>Scientific interpretation:</strong> Shadows are formed as a result of objects blocking light. As the light source (the sun) moves, the shadow moves in the opposite direction. This movement is governed by precise physical laws (straight line propagation of light). The submission of objects and light to these laws is the essence of their prostration.</p>
        <p><strong>Contemplation:</strong> When you see your shadow extending on the ground, remember that it is in a state of prostration to God. Your shadow may be more submissive than you! This calls for humility and following the example of your shadow in submission to God.</p>

        <h3>II: The reverence of the mountains</h3>
        <p>Mountains, despite their rigidity and hugeness, are described in the Qur'an as humble and cracking from the fear of God.</p>
        <div class="box box-verse">
            <span class="box-title">Verse</span>
            <span class="verse-text">"If We had sent down this Qur'an upon a mountain, you would have seen it humbled and cracking from fear of Allah."</span>
            <span class="verse-ref">[Al-Hashr: 21]</span>
        </div>
        <p>This verse shows that mountains possess a kind of perception that enables them to be influenced by God's words to the point of cracking. It is a rebuke to the harsh human hearts that are not affected by the Qur'an.</p>

        <h3>Third: The mountains fall from the fear of God</h3>
        <div class="box box-verse">
            <span class="box-title">Verse</span>
            <span class="verse-text">"And indeed, there are stones out of which rivers gush forth, and indeed, there are of them (stones) which split asunder so that water flows from them, and indeed, there are of them (stones) which fall down for fear of Allah."</span>
            <span class="verse-ref">[Al-Baqarah: 74]</span>
        </div>
        <p>This verse explicitly states that some stones fall from the top of mountains out of fear of God. This is not a metaphor, but a reality that we may not understand its mechanism.</p>
        <p><strong>Scientific interpretation:</strong> Geologically, rocks fall due to factors such as gravity, erosion, and earthquakes. But the Qur'an adds a dimension of faith, which is that these physical causes are commanded by God, and that the stone "responds" to this command in a state of fear and submission.</p>

        <h3>Fourth: The prostration of the sun, moon and stars</h3>
        <p>Celestial bodies are in a state of constant prostration through their disciplined movement in their orbits.</p>
        <div class="box box-verse">
            <span class="box-title">Verse</span>
            <span class="verse-text">"And the sun runs to its resting place. That is the decree of the Exalted in Might, the Knowing."</span>
            <span class="verse-ref">[Ya-Sin: 38]</span>
        </div>
        <p>There is a wonderful hadith describing the prostration of the sun. On the authority of Abu Dharr (may Allah be pleased with him), the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to him when the sun set: "Do you know where it goes?" I said: "Allah and His Messenger know best." He said: "It goes and prostrates under the Throne, so it asks for permission and is given permission, and it is about to prostrate but it will not be accepted from it, and it asks for permission but it will not be given permission. It will be said to it: 'Go back from where you came,' and it will rise from its setting place." (Agreed upon).</p>
        <p>This hadith confirms that the sun has a real prostration under the Throne, a prostration that fits its nature as a huge celestial body. This prostration is renewed every day, and is an expression of its constant obedience to God's command to rise and set.</p>

        <div class="box box-science">
            <span class="box-title">Reconciling the Hadith with Science</span>
            <p>Some may ask how the sun prostrates under the Throne when it is always shining on one side of the earth? Scholars have answered this in several ways:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Throne surrounds the entire universe, so the sun is always under the Throne wherever it is.</li>
                <li>Prostration is a state of submission and submission, not necessarily a physical movement like human prostration.</li>
                <li>The hadith speaks about unseen matters (the world of the unseen) that cannot be measured by the laws of the seen world. We believe in it as it came and entrust the knowledge of its modality to God.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>Fifth: The prostration of the trees</h3>
        <p>Trees prostrate to God, and this prostration may be through their shadows as mentioned previously, or it may be a real prostration in a way we do not see.</p>
        <div class="box box-note">
            <span class="box-title">The Tree's Supplication</span>
            <p>There is a narration that a tree prostrated when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) recited the verse of prostration. On the authority of Ibn Abbas (may Allah be pleased with them), he said: "A man came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said: 'O Messenger of Allah, I saw myself last night while I was sleeping as if I was praying behind a tree. I prostrated and the tree prostrated for my prostration, and I heard it saying: "O Allah, write for me a reward with You for it, and remove a burden from me for it, and make it a treasure for me with You, and accept it from me as You accepted it from Your servant David."' Ibn Abbas said: 'So the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) recited a prostration verse and then prostrated, and I heard him saying the same words that the man had informed him that the tree had said.'" (Narrated by Al-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah).</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Sixth: The prostration of animals</h3>
        <p>Animals of all kinds prostrate to God. <em>"And the beasts"</em> [Al-Hajj: 18].</p>
        <p>This prostration may be by placing their chins on the ground, or it may be by their submission to God and their glorification of Him.</p>
        <div class="box box-verse">
            <span class="box-title">Hadith</span>
            <p>Imam Ahmad narrated in his Musnad that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: "There is no beast but that it is subordinate to God on Friday morning until the sun rises, out of fear of the Hour, except for the jinn and mankind."</p>
        </div>
        <p>This fear and apprehension of the Hour is a form of awareness and interaction with the unseen realities, which is part of the concept of cosmic prostration.</p>

        <h3>Seventh: The Prostration of Many People</h3>
        <p>The verse in Surah Al-Hajj distinguishes between two groups of people: <em>"and many of the people, and many upon whom the punishment is due."</em></p>
        <p>The first group are the believers who prostrate to God voluntarily and by choice. These are in harmony with the cosmic system of prostration.</p>
        <p>The second group are the disbelievers who refused to prostrate. These are the anomalous exception in this universe. Although their bodies and cells prostrate to God (submit to His laws), their wills and hearts are arrogant.</p>
        <p><em>"And whoever Allah humiliates, there is no one to honor him."</em> This indicates that refusing to prostrate is a humiliation, while prostration is dignity and honor.</p>

        <h2>Research III: Evidence of Prostration in the Sunnah</h2>
        <p>The Prophet's Sunnah is replete with situations that confirm the prostration and humility of the universe.</p>

        <div class="box box-note">
            <span class="box-title">The Yearning of the Palm Trunk</span>
            <p>The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to deliver his sermons leaning on a palm trunk in his mosque. When a pulpit was made for him and he moved to it, the trunk moaned like a crying child until the Prophet came down and embraced it until it calmed down. (Narrated by Al-Bukhari).</p>
            <p>This moaning is an expression of the trunk's love for the Prophet and its sorrow for losing the proximity of his noble body. It is a form of emotion and awareness in inanimate objects (or plants that have been cut).</p>
        </div>

        <div class="box box-note">
            <span class="box-title">The Pebble's Tasbih</span>
            <p>We mentioned earlier the hadith of the pebbles glorifying in the Prophet's hand. This audible glorification is a form of voluntary submission and worship by inanimate objects.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="box box-note">
            <span class="box-title">The Mountain's Love</span>
            <p>The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said about Mount Uhud: "This is a mountain that loves us and we love it." (Agreed upon).</p>
            <p>Love is an emotion of the heart. Attributing it to a mountain indicates that mountains have hearts or entities capable of emotions. And love for the Messenger of God is the pinnacle of obedience and closeness to God.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Research IV: The Scientific Perspective on the Prostration of the Universe</h2>
        <p>Can we find echoes of the concept of prostration in modern science? Although science deals with physical mechanisms, some phenomena can be interpreted in light of the concept of submission and yielding.</p>

        <div class="box box-science">
            <span class="box-title">Universal Laws</span>
            <p>The entire universe, from atoms to galaxies, is governed by strict physical laws (gravity, electromagnetism, nuclear forces). No atom can deviate from these laws. This absolute submission to the "Laws of Nature" is the scientific equivalent of the concept of "Involuntary Prostration" or submission to the cosmic command of God.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="box box-science">
            <span class="box-title">Phototropism and Gravitropism in Plants</span>
            <p>Plants exhibit movements called "tropisms".<br>
            <strong>Phototropism:</strong> The plant bends towards the light.<br>
            <strong>Gravitropism:</strong> Roots grow downwards (towards gravity) and stems grow upwards.<br>
            These movements are mechanisms of submission to the laws of life that God has placed in them. The shadows mentioned in the Qur'an are a direct result of the interaction of objects with light, which is governed by precise physical laws.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="box box-science">
            <span class="box-title">Resonance and Vibration</span>
            <p>Everything in the universe vibrates. Atoms vibrate, molecules vibrate. This constant vibration is the "life" of matter. Perhaps this vibration is the physical manifestation of the "Tasbih" (Glorification) and "Sujud" (Prostration) mentioned in the texts. When a material is subjected to stress, it may crack or change shape (like mountains cracking). Science calls it stress/strain, faith calls it fear/awe.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Fifth Research: Faith and Educational Implications</h2>
        <p>Believing in the prostration of the universe is not just theoretical information, but has deep effects on the soul and behavior.</p>

        <div class="box box-reflection">
            <span class="box-title">1. Feeling of Unity and Harmony</span>
            <p>When a believer prostrates in his prayer, he feels that he is not alone. He is participating in a cosmic ritual in which millions of galaxies, billions of stars, and trillions of atoms participate. He enters into harmony with the entire universe. This removes the feeling of alienation and loneliness.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="box box-reflection">
            <span class="box-title">2. Humility and Breaking of Arrogance</span>
            <p>If the great mountains, the burning stars, and the vast heavens are all prostrating to God, who are you, O weak human, to be arrogant? The prostration of the universe teaches man his true size and invites him to be humble before the greatness of the Creator.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="box box-reflection">
            <span class="box-title">3. Glorification of God</span>
            <p>Seeing the whole universe in a state of submission increases the believer's glorification of his Lord. He realizes that God is the King to whom all necks bow and all foreheads prostrate.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="box box-reflection">
            <span class="box-title">4. Reverence in Prayer</span>
            <p>Remembering the prostration of the universe during prayer helps to achieve reverence (Khushu'). When you say "Allahu Akbar" and fall down in prostration, imagine that the earth beneath you, the air around you, and the sky above you are all prostrating with you.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="box box-reflection">
            <span class="box-title">5. Environmental Awareness</span>
            <p>Realizing that nature (trees, animals, mountains) are worshipping and prostrating creatures generates a sense of respect for them. They are not just resources to be exploited, but partners in worship. This establishes an Islamic environmental ethic based on preservation and non-corruption.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Chapter Conclusion</h2>
        <p>In this chapter, we have reviewed the Qur'anic evidence of the prostration of the universe to God, and we have shown that this prostration is genuine and stems from a true awareness and realization of the greatness of the Creator.</p>
        <p>We cited Qur'anic verses and hadiths that speak of the prostration of creatures to God, and presented the statements and stories of the Salaf in this regard, especially the story of the palm tree trunk that bowed to the Prophet, the story of the prostration of pebbles and food, and the story of the prostration of the sun under the throne.</p>
        <p>We also shed light on some recent scientific studies that point to manifestations of responsiveness and consciousness in creatures, and showed how these manifestations can be understood in light of the Qur'anic prostration of creatures to God Almighty.</p>
        <p>We concluded the chapter by explaining the faith and educational implications of believing in the prostration of the universe to God, and how this belief leads to deepening faith in God, prostration to Him, reverence in prayer, humility to Him, and obedience to His command.</p>
        <p>We invite you, dear reader, to look at the universe with new eyes, eyes that see the prostration in the shadows, the reverence in the mountains, and the submission in the stars. We invite you to live the experience of a "Cosmic Prostration," where your heart prostrates before your forehead, and your soul meets the soul of the universe in the sanctuary of the One, the Subduer.</p>
        <p>In the next chapter, we will deal with the subject of the feelings and emotions of the universe, which is another aspect of the universe's awareness and realization.</p>
