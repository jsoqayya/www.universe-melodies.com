    <h1>Chapter Twelve <br>From the Atom to the Galaxy - One Praiseful Universe</h1>

    <div class="box desc-box">
        <strong>Chapter Description:</strong> This chapter explores a profound scientific and spiritual journey through the different levels of existence, starting from consciousness at the atomic level, where the phenomena of quantum entanglement and the conscious behavior of atoms are manifested in their organized interactions and their submission to the divine laws. He moves to the cellular level, which reveals the miracle of life and praise in the intelligent behavior of cells and their complex systems, from energy production in the mitochondria to programmed cell death as an altruistic act, while exploring the quantum basis of cellular consciousness in microtubules. He then moves on to the cosmic level, presenting the miracle of order in the movement of celestial bodies and the subtle cosmic constants, showing how the entire universe praises God through its amazing regularity and miraculous balance. The chapter concludes with a discussion of unified consciousness, which links all levels of existence from the atom to the galaxy in one praised universe, exploring quantum consciousness as a unifying foundation that manifests itself in quantum entanglement and the deep interconnectedness of the components of the universe. Finally, it offers contemplative visions and future perspectives on the limitations of human knowledge in front of the secrets of the universe, and the amazing harmony between the Qur'an and modern science in understanding cosmic consciousness, concluding with deep spiritual and existential reflections on the reality of the praised universe and how man can participate in this great cosmic symphony. This chapter presents an integrative vision that combines science and faith, emphasizing that every atom in the universe testifies to the oneness and greatness of God, and that man is called upon to consciously and willingly join this comprehensive cosmic praise that extends from the smallest particles to the largest galaxies.

    <h2>Introduction: Symphony of the Conscious Universe</h2>
    
    <div class="box quran-box">
        “The seven heavens and the earth and whatever is in them exalt Him. And there is not a thing except that it exalts [Allah] by His praise, but you do not understand their [way of] exalting. Indeed, He is ever Forbearing and Forgiving.”<br>
        (Al-Israa'a: 44)
    </div>

    <p>In the vastness of the universe, life breathes in every atom and the beats of existence flow through every star and galaxy. From the smallest subatomic particle to the greatest galaxies, we witness an integrated cosmic symphony that plays to the rhythm of the eternal praise of the Great Creator.</p>
    <p>It is not just a random coincidence, but carries within it the most profound signs of creativity and the ingenuity of divine design, which testifies to a comprehensive cosmic consciousness, represented by the submission of all components of existence to their Creator, and their silent praise to Him Almighty.</p>
    
    <p>Since the dawn of time, humans have wondered about the mystery and nature of the universe. Is it just inanimate matter governed by blind laws, as the materialists claim, or is it a living organism that pulsates with consciousness? In this chapter, we will embark on a voyage of discovery from the depths of the atom to the horizons of distant galaxies, exploring the secrets of consciousness manifested in all levels of existence.</p>
    <p>We will contemplate the astonishing precision of the atom's design, the extraordinary intelligence of the cell, and the marvelous order that governs the movement of galaxies and stars.</p>
    <p>We will see how all these levels of existence share one essential characteristic: They praise God and submit to His command, expressing a universal cosmic consciousness that flows like a flowing river, permeating all of creation.</p>
    
    <p>In the light of the latest scientific discoveries in the field of quantum physics and theories of quantum consciousness, we will see how contemporary science has begun to approach - albeit slowly - the understanding of the reality of cosmic consciousness that the Holy Quran referred to more than fourteen centuries ago. How the concept of quantum entanglement offers us a fascinating scientific explanation of how consciousness is interconnected across different levels of existence, from the atom to the galaxy.</p>
    
    <p>This journey is not just a review of cold scientific facts, but an invitation to deep contemplation of the magnificent creation of the Creator, and to realize that the entire universe - with all its components - testifies to the oneness and greatness of God, through its elaborate laws and magnificent order. It is an invitation for us to participate in this great cosmic praise, and to realize that we are only a small part of this amazing cosmic symphony, which plays the melody of "Subhanallah and Praise be to Him" from the smallest atom to the largest galaxy.</p>

    <h2>Exhibit I: Consciousness at the atomic level: Quantum entanglement</h2>
    
    <h3>I: The Dance of Consciousness in the Theater of Atoms</h3>
    <p>In the depths of existence, where particles of matter glow and electrons dance in their orbits with wondrous lightness, a timeless question has haunted scientists and philosophers alike: Could it be that consciousness, that deep sense of being, is embedded in the very core of the atomic and quantum world?</p>
    <p>Classical science has long explained consciousness as the result of complex interactions between brain neurons. But delving into the quantum world, with its paradoxes and oddities, has revealed phenomena that shake our certainties: Particles that exist in more than one place at once, and atoms that communicate instantaneously across vast distances [Fundamental Principles of Quantum Mechanics, American Institute of Physics].</p>

    <h4>Consciousness and quantum: Collision or harmony?</h4>
    <p>That inner feeling that characterizes every human being - the ability to feel, perceive, and reflect on oneself - seems to be beyond any purely materialistic explanation. How can rigid physical structures, atoms and molecules, produce subjective experience? This is exactly where what is known in contemporary philosophy as the "hard problem of consciousness" arises.</p>
    <p>In 1995, Australian philosopher David Chalmers coined the term in his famous article "Facing Up to the Problem of Consciousness" published in the Journal of Consciousness Studies, where he distinguished between the "easy" (describing brain functions) and the "hard" (explaining how subjective experience arises).</p>

    <h3>II: Scientific hypotheses about quantum consciousness:</h3>
    <p>With the development of quantum physics - the branch that studies the behavior of tiny, invisible particles - new hypotheses are emerging that suggest that "consciousness may not be a classical product of the brain, but an intrinsically quantum phenomenon".</p>

    <div class="box science-box">
        <strong>A. The Quantum Mind Hypothesis (Orch-OR)</strong><br>
        In this theory, proposed by Stuart Hameroff and Roger Penrose, it is hypothesized that quantum processes occur within the microtubules of neurons that produce the experience of consciousness. The hypothesis is known as "Orchestrated Objective Reduction (Orch OR)" and its most prominent details were published in a 2014 paper in the journal Physics of Life Reviews.
    </div>

    <div class="box science-box">
        <strong>B. The Two-Face Hypothesis</strong><br>
        This theory is "essentially philosophical" and has its roots in the works of Spinoza and Schelling, and has been re-adopted by a number of contemporary thinkers such as Harald Atmanshaper. It states that "matter and consciousness are two sides of one irreducible reality" just as "light" can be treated as a wave or a particle in physics.
    </div>

    <p><strong>C. Criticism of physicists</strong><br>
    Despite the philosophical and scientific appeal of these theories, most of the physics community is "highly skeptical". In his 2000 article "The Myth of Quantum Consciousness" published in The Humanist, physicist Victor Stenger described quantum consciousness as a scientific myth that is not based on experimentation or proof.</p>
    <p>Christoph Koch, director of the Allen Institute for Brain Research, in his book The Quest for Consciousness: A Neurobiological Approach (2004) also expressed skepticism: "The brain is a very humid and warm environment, making it unlikely that subtle quantum phenomena can persist there without being collapsed by heat and biological noise."</p>
    
    <p>While scientists and philosophers are divided on the quantum basis of consciousness, there seems to be a tacit consensus that our consciousness is the most complex in existence. Whether it is the result of complex molecular interactions, or a cosmic entanglement that transcends time and space, it remains the most intractable mystery of 21st century science.</p>
    <p>Perhaps these complexities do not mean a clash between quantum and consciousness, but rather that quantum opens a new window to understand the self, not just as a neural machine, but as a being that interacts with the universe on a deeper, more subtle, and perhaps more "spiritual" level than we thought.</p>

    <h3>III: The Double Slit Experiment: When observation changes reality</h3>
    <p>To understand the possible relationship between <strong>consciousness and the quantum world</strong>, it is necessary to look at one of the strangest and most important experiments in the history of physics: The double-slit experiment. This experiment reveals that <strong>what we know about reality can change just by observing it.</strong></p>

    <h4>What does the experiment say?</h4>
    <p>Imagine that we shoot electrons - tiny particles that are part of an atom - toward a barrier with two small slits. Behind the barrier is a screen that records where the electrons arrive.<br>
    When <strong>we don't watch</strong> the electrons pass through the slits, the screen shows an <strong>interference pattern</strong>, similar to what happens when a <strong>wave of water</strong> passes through two holes and interferes. This means that the electron is behaving like a wave, and it looks like it's passing through <strong>both</strong> slits at the same time!</p>
    <p>However, when <strong>we measure</strong> or observe the path the electron takes, the interference pattern suddenly disappears, and instead a pattern that resembles the behavior of ordinary <strong>particles</strong> appears - as if the electron has chosen to pass through only one slit.</p>
    
    <div class="box quote-box">
        As the famous physicist Richard Feynman said in his lectures: "This experiment contains the core of the whole puzzle of quantum mechanics."<br>
        (The Feynman Lectures on Physics, Vol. 3, 1965).
    </div>

    <h4>Does consciousness affect matter?</h4>
    <p>This puzzling phenomenon raises a big question: Does our mere observation change what is happening? Does human consciousness play a role in shaping reality?</p>

    <p><strong>Copenhagen Interpretation: No need for consciousness</strong><br>
    The traditional explanation for this phenomenon is known as the <strong>Copenhagen Interpretation</strong>, put forward in the early 20th century by scientists such as Niels Bohr and Heisenberg. According to this interpretation:
    <ul>
        <li>A quantum system (such as an electron) exists in a "potential" state before measurement.</li>
        <li>The process of <strong>measurement</strong> is what "forces" the system to choose a specific state (passing through the left or right slit, for example).</li>
    </ul>
    But the observer does not have to be a conscious human being. The mere presence of a <strong>physical interaction</strong> (a device that records data) is enough to turn probability into reality.</p>

    <p><strong>Observer consciousness: Does it play a role?</strong><br>
    Some scientists have questioned the adequacy of this explanation. Nobel Prize-winning physicist Eugene Wigner asked in his famous paper "Remarks on the Mind-Body Question" (1961): Could it be that the <strong>consciousness of the observer himself</strong> - not just the apparatus - is the decisive factor that makes one of the possibilities a reality?</p>
    <p>To provoke discussion, imagine a hypothetical experiment known as <strong>Wegener's Friend</strong>: What if there is one person inside a room conducting the experiment, and another outside who does not yet know the result? Does reality collapse for the inside observer before the outside? Does the electron remain in a state of "possibility" until one of them informs the other? These questions continue to spark philosophical and scientific debate to this day.</p>

    <p><strong>From Quantum Physics to the Depths of the Self</strong><br>
    The double-slit experiment shows that <strong>observation changes the physical behavior</strong> of tiny particles. The traditional explanation is that physical interaction is enough to explain this, with no need to introduce consciousness. But some argue that consciousness may be more than a bystander - it may be an active element in "choosing reality". This experiment doesn't just tell us about electrons... It opens the door to <strong>major existential questions</strong>: Is the universe waiting for us to notice it until it manifests? Is our consciousness connected to the deepest layers of reality?</p>

    <h3>IV: Quantum Entanglement: Hidden connections between minds?</h3>
    <p>Among the most complex phenomena of modern physics, quantum entanglement stands out as one of the most surprising and philosophical questions. According to this phenomenon, two entangled particles remain strangely connected: As soon as we measure the state of one, the state of the other is immediately determined, regardless of the distance between them. This is what Albert Einstein sarcastically described as "spooky action at a distance" in his critique of the interpretation of quantum mechanics.</p>
    <p>This phenomenon was demonstrated in the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) experiment in 1935, which aimed to highlight what Einstein considered to be the "shortcomings of quantum mechanics" in that it did not provide a complete description of physical reality.</p>

    <h4>What is quantum entanglement?</h4>
    <p>Quantum Entanglement is a physical phenomenon that occurs when subatomic particles (such as photons or electrons) interact in such a way that the state of each particle is correlated with the other, regardless of the distance between them. In other words, when we measure a certain property of the first particle (such as spin), we immediately know the corresponding property of the second particle, even if it is at the other end of the universe.</p>

    <div class="box science-box">
        <strong>Crucial experiments that proved quantum entanglement</strong>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>John Clauser and Stuart Friedman Experiment (1972):</strong> The first practical experiment to test Bell's Inequality. Proved that correlated particles communicate instantaneously, bypassing the speed limit imposed by special relativity.</li>
            <li><strong>The Alain Aspey Experiment (1982):</strong> Confirmed correlations beyond what classical theories allow, supporting the predictions of quantum mechanics and Local Realism. Aspeh was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2022.</li>
            <li><strong>Anton Zeilinger's Team Experiment (1998):</strong> Used coherent photons sent over 400 meters via fiber optic cables. Showed instant correlations, confirming the "non-locality" of the universe. Zelinger was also awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2022.</li>
            <li><strong>China's Mesius Satellite Experiment (2017):</strong> Tested quantum entanglement at astronomical distances (1,200 km), proving it persists over vast distances.</li>
            <li><strong>A recent study published in Nature in 2023:</strong> Confirmed entanglement between particles separated by large distances with ultra-precise measurements, showing the effect was faster than the speed of light.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h4>Toward a deeper understanding of cosmic consciousness</h4>
    <p>Quantum entanglement experiments provide scientific evidence of a phenomenon that challenges our traditional understanding of reality and opens the door to new insights into the nature of consciousness and existence.</p>
    <p>In his book <em>Mindful Universe: Quantum Mechanics and the Common Observer</em>, Henry Stapp discusses how quantum mechanics, especially the phenomenon of quantum entanglement, suggests that the universe is not just an assembly of separate parts, but an interconnected system where events in one part affect other parts, regardless of the distance between them. "The quantum universe is an interconnected whole, where measurements in one place lead to instantaneous changes in the quantum state on a large scale," Stapp explains.</p>
    
    <p>These scientific discoveries converge dramatically with the Qur'anic vision of a praising universe, where every atom in existence praises its Creator and is connected to everything else in an integrated cosmic fabric, and give us a new scientific horizon to understand the words of the Almighty:</p>
    <div class="box quran-box">
        “The seven heavens and the earth and whatever is in them exalt Him. And there is not a thing except that it exalts [Allah] by His praise, but you do not understand their [way of] exalting. Indeed, He is ever Forbearing and Forgiving."<br>
        [Al-Israa: 44].
    </div>

    <h3>V: From Electrons to Minds: Is there entanglement?</h3>
    <p>While quantum mechanics confirms these phenomena at the subatomic level, some scientists are beginning to ask a bold question: Could similar entanglement occur within the human brain? Could this explain some features of consciousness such as unity of perception or even "telepathy"?</p>
    <p>In the <em>Journal of Neuroscience</em>, Tononi and Edelman (1998) wondered how the brain produces a unified experience of consciousness, even though it consists of billions of neurons. They suggested that the unity of consciousness may be the product of deeply interconnected mechanisms, perhaps not limited to electrical connections alone.</p>

    <p><strong>New hypotheses: Entanglement in our neurons?</strong><br>
    In their study, titled "Generation of Entangled Biphoton Pairs in the Myelin Shell", the lipid shell called myelin, which envelops the axons of neurons, may provide a suitable environment for the generation of quantum entangled photon pairs via the interaction of carbon and hydrogen atoms.</p>
    
    <p>This hypothesis - though in need of stronger experimental support - is gaining some traction as biological research has uncovered <strong>quantum mechanisms demonstrated in living organisms</strong>:
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Photosynthesis in plants:</strong> In a study published in <em>Nature</em> in 2007 led by Fleming et al, quantum efficiency in energy transfer within photosynthetic centers was revealed.</li>
        <li><strong>The bio-compass of migratory birds:</strong> A study in <em>Nature Communications</em> in 2016 showed that birds use a mechanism based on quantum interactions between electrons to determine directions.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p><strong>Between consciousness and entanglement: Hypothesis or discovery?</strong><br>
    Could it be that there is an entanglement between human minds or even between the human mind and the universe? Although these questions have yet to be definitively answered, quantum physics is paving the way for a new phase of scientific thinking - where matter and consciousness are no longer two separate entities, but a single network that interacts across levels we do not yet recognize.</p>

    <p><strong>How does quantum entanglement happen?</strong><br>
    Although experiments have succeeded in proving the existence of quantum entanglement, how it occurs is still the subject of deep philosophical and scientific debate. There are several explanations:
    <ol>
        <li><strong>The traditional Copenhagen interpretation:</strong> Particles do not have specific properties prior to measurement.</li>
        <li><strong>The Many Worlds Theory:</strong> Every possible outcome occurs in a parallel universe.</li>
        <li><strong>David Bohm's Theory of Implicit Order:</strong> Bohm sees the entire universe as an "undivided whole". What we see as separate particles are just surface manifestations of a deeper, connected reality.</li>
    </ol>
    </p>

    <div class="box quote-box">
        In his book "Wholeness and the Implicate Order", Bohm states:<br>
        "At the deepest level, the universe is an undivided whole, an interconnected system that cannot be divided into independent parts. Each part of the universe 'folds' within itself the entire universe, just as each part of a hologram contains information about the whole."
    </div>

    <h3>VI: Consciousness and Intentionality in the World of Atoms</h3>
    <p>The idea that atoms - inanimate entities - have some kind of <strong>"consciousness" or "intentionality"</strong> may seem strange at first glance. But when we study their behavior more closely, we find patterns that go beyond what can be explained by pure chance:</p>
    
    <p><strong>Self-organization of atoms</strong><br>
    The ability of atoms to organize themselves into complex structures and exhibit entirely new properties at higher levels cannot be explained by simple physical laws. Take the transformation of hydrogen and oxygen atoms into the water molecule - water exhibits unique properties that are quite different from its constituent elements. This amazing ability to self-organize and produce new emergent properties suggests a kind of "latent intelligence" in matter, as if it were following a pre-established plan.</p>

    <p><strong>Harmonious interaction between atoms</strong><br>
    Atoms interact with each other in harmonious and precise ways, like a harmonious musical orchestra. Without this harmony, complex organic compounds such as proteins and DNA would not exist, and life would not be possible. Scientist Albert Szent-Györgyi (the discoverer of vitamin C) observed that this system is too complex to be mere chance, describing it as "an organization beyond the simple understanding of ordinary chemistry."</p>

    <p><strong>The astonishing precision in the construction of life's molecules</strong><br>
    Atoms in nature operate according to precise laws that determine how they combine to form complex molecules. These laws are not random, but follow consistent mathematical patterns.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Chemical bonds:</strong> Governed by specific laws (e.g., carbon forms four bonds).</li>
        <li><strong>Proteins:</strong> Fold into specific 3D shapes within microseconds.</li>
        <li><strong>DNA:</strong> Uses a precise coding system (A, T, G, C).</li>
        <li><strong>Water:</strong> The angle of 104.5 degrees gives it unique properties.</li>
        <li><strong>Mathematical precision:</strong> Chemical reactions follow strict ratios (e.g. H2O is 2:1).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>VII: The miraculous design within the atom</h3>
    <p>For approximation: If an atom were the size of a football field, its nucleus would be the size of a small pea at its center. As small as it is, that nucleus contains more than 99.9% of the atom's mass. Electrons orbit around it in near-empty space. This enormous percentage of "vacuum" within the atom is what makes matter compressible, and explains how, at the microscopic level, most of the universe is an "organized vacuum".</p>
    <p>But the real miracle lies in the delicate balance of forces within the atom: The strong nuclear force that holds protons and neutrons together inside the nucleus must be very carefully tuned. If this force were even a tiny bit stronger, heavy atoms would quickly collapse. If it were weaker, nuclei would not form at all. This is what is known as the "fine-tuning" of the universe.</p>

    <div class="box quote-box">
        In his book The Goldilocks Enigma, renowned physicist Paul Davies comments on this phenomenon:<br>
        "The universe is amazingly fine-tuned to host life... If the laws of physics were even slightly different, there might not be galaxies, stars, planets, atoms, or any of the basic components of life."
    </div>

    <p><strong>The atom: Between science and faith</strong><br>
    This marvelous consistency in the simplest components of existence is not a mere coincidence for the believer; it is proof that this universe is governed by precise fixed laws, and that behind these laws is an omniscient and almighty Creator.</p>
    <div class="box quran-box">
        'Who created and leveled. And He who has provided guidance."<br>
        (Al-A'ala: 2-3)
    </div>

    <p><strong>The miracle of the formation of the element carbon</strong><br>
    Consider with me the element carbon, the basis of life on earth. This vital element is formed in the centers of stars through a strange reaction that seems to be specially designed for this purpose. First, two helium atoms combine to form beryllium, an extremely unstable element that decomposes in 0.000000000000001 seconds! And therein lies the miracle - for carbon to form, a third helium atom must collide with beryllium before it decays, and the energy level must be exactly at the right "resonant level".</p>
    
    <div class="box quote-box">
        Professor Fred Hoyle, a famous British astronomer (and atheist), was so amazed at the precision of the energy levels that allow carbon to form, that he stated: "The logic of common sense clearly indicates that this process of carbon formation is deliberately designed... The design of the universe cannot be explained by any purely random mechanisms."
    </div>

    <h3>VIII: Atoms Praise God</h3>
    <p>If we look at the atom from the perspective of modern scientific discoveries and the vision of the Holy Qur'an, we can see its praise to God through:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Submission to divine laws:</strong> Every atom is subject to physical laws with extreme precision.</li>
        <li><strong>Performing the job perfectly:</strong> Every atom performs its specific role in existence with amazing perfection.</li>
        <li><strong>Responding to divine commands:</strong> Atoms respond and adapt to the surrounding conditions with extreme precision.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="box quote-box">
        Dr. Amit Goswami, professor of physics at the University of Oregon, says in his book <em>The Self-Aware Universe</em>:<br>
        "The quantum world suggests that consciousness is fundamental to existence, and that matter itself possesses a kind of fundamental consciousness that manifests itself in its behavior."
    </div>

    <h2>Section II: Consciousness at the cellular level: The Miracle of Life and Praise</h2>
    <p>The cell: An integrated city in a microscopic entity. The cell, a microscopic entity that is often only one hundredth of a millimeter in size, is a miracle in itself. It is not just a random collection of molecules, but a complex system that works with precision and perfection that surpasses the most sophisticated factories in the world.</p>
    <p>Dr. Bruce Lipton, in his book <em>The Biology of Belief</em> (2005), mentions the innate intelligence of cells and their ability to interact and make decisions. "Every cell is a living, breathing entity that processes information, communicates with other cells, and makes decisions. In fact, cells are smarter than we admit-they can learn, remember, and adapt to changes in their environment."</p>

    <h3>I: The Conscious Behavior of the Cell</h3>
    <p>On a quiet night, as I contemplated images of mitochondria under an electron microscope, I was struck by an astonishment that I remember to this day. How could these microscopic structures produce so much energy more efficiently than our most complex factories?</p>
    <p><strong>ATP synthase: The Amazing Molecular Machine</strong><br>
    In 1997, Professor Paul Boyer, Nobel Laureate in Chemistry, devoted an entire paper to this enzyme, and gave it a telling title: "ATP synthase - a marvelous molecular machine". The enzyme acts like a nanoscale rotary engine, spinning at up to 150 revolutions per second, producing three ATP molecules with each full revolution! Imagine a car engine the size of your thumb that runs at over 90% efficiency.</p>

    <div class="box science-box">
        <strong>Irreducible complexity: A scientific challenge</strong><br>
        Professor Michael Behe describes in his book <em>Darwin's Black Box</em>: "Irreducible complexity is a single system made up of several interacting, coordinated parts that contribute to an essential function, where the removal of any one of the parts causes the system to effectively cease functioning."
    </div>

    <p><strong>The cell regulates traffic within the cell</strong><br>
    Inside the cell, there is a transportation system more complex than an entire city's transportation network. Scientists from the 2013 Nobel Prize in Medicine and Physiology discovered the mechanisms that regulate the movement of vesicles within the cell. "The cell possesses an elaborate internal transportation system... This mechanism operates with a precision and timeliness that surpasses the most sophisticated traffic systems in the world."</p>

    <p><strong>Cells that commit suicide so as not to harm the body</strong><br>
    One of the most surprising phenomena in the world of cells is called <strong>apoptosis</strong>, where a cell - when it becomes diseased or harmful to the body - activates a self-suicide mechanism! When a cell is damaged or infected, it triggers a complex internal mechanism that leads to its own self-destruction. It's like saying "my life for the safety of the whole body"!</p>
    
    <div class="box quote-box">
        Dr. Harris Perlman of Stanford University says: "What we're seeing here is a self-sacrifice system programmed with amazing precision. The cell is saying: 'If I can't do my job properly, I'd better remove myself before I cause harm to the whole organism.'"

    <h3>II: The Quantum Basis of Cellular Consciousness</h3>
    <p>Microtubules: Channels of Quantum Consciousness. Science today is taking bold steps towards redefining consciousness from a quantum perspective. Developed by Nobel Prize-winning physicist Sir Roger Penrose in collaboration with anesthesiologist Stuart Hameroff and known as <strong>Orchestrated Objective Reduction</strong>, the exciting theory proposes that consciousness is not just a chemical product, but a quantum phenomenon that occurs in intracellular structures called <strong>microtubules</strong>.</p>
    <p>In 2022, a team of researchers published an important study in the <em>Journal of Physics Communications</em> showing that microtubules can maintain quantum coherence for longer periods than previously thought.</p>

    <h3>III: The Cell Praises God: Beyond Physical Science</h3>
    <p>When I contemplate this amazing order at the cellular level, it is hard not to see it as a reflection of a larger cosmic order. Cells work in precise order and dazzling harmony, as if they are responding to laws that are programmed into them.</p>
    
    <div class="box quote-box">
        Dr. Anthony Flew says: "The astonishing complexity of the mechanisms by which the cell works - especially the mechanisms of DNA transcription and translation - suggests that there is an infinite intelligence behind this impressive system... This system behaves like an entity operating according to a predetermined plan."
    </div>

    <p>There are three main aspects of cell behavior that make me see it as a silent praise to the Creator:
    <ol>
        <li>Submission to divine order.</li>
        <li>Integration in performance.</li>
        <li>Altruism and sacrifice.</li>

    <h3>I: A journey into the vastness of the universe</h3>
    <p>According to the James Webb Space Telescope's latest estimate in 2024, there may be between 200 billion and 2 trillion galaxies in the observable universe. Imagine that enormous number: Each galaxy has hundreds of billions of stars, and each star could be the center of a unique solar system!</p>
    
    <div class="box quran-box">
        " “It is not for the sun to overtake the moon, nor does the night outpace the day; each is travelling in its own orbit.”"<br>
        [Surat Yā ‑ S ī n: 40].
    </div>

    <p><strong>The amazing order in the universe</strong><br>
    According to a study published in <em>Nature Astronomy</em> in March 2023, astronomers have discovered that our Milky Way galaxy rotates in precise harmony with a phenomenon called "passing density waves," stable patterns in the distribution of matter that help keep the galaxy stable over billions of years.</p>

    <h3>II: The subtle cosmological constants: The Dance of Cosmic Numbers</h3>
    <p>But the biggest miracle lies in the fundamental physical constants that govern the universe. There are more than 30 physical constants, such as the gravitational constant, Planck's constant, and the electromagnetic constant, all of which are finely tuned.</p>
    <p>If the gravitational constant changed by, say, 1/10^40 (that's 1 followed by 40 zeros), the universe would collapse or stars would not exist. If the strength of a weak nuclear reaction varied by just 1%, the precise equation that allows helium to be produced in stars would not exist, and the cycle of life would collapse.</p>
    
    <div class="box quote-box">
        Professor Stephen Hawking, despite his atheism, acknowledged this conundrum in his book "A Brief History of Time", saying: "There seems to be a very fine tuning of physical laws and constants in the universe... The probability of this fine-tuning by chance is too small to be negligible."
    </div>

    <p><strong>The delicate balance of fundamental forces</strong><br>
    The four fundamental forces in nature - the strong nuclear force, the weak nuclear force, the electromagnetic force, and the gravitational force - are balanced with astonishing precision. British physicist John Polkinghorne says: "The precision of the balance between the fundamental forces is like walking a rope that is one-tenth the width of 10^60... This is not just 'good luck'... It's perfect design."</p>

    <h3>Third: The Universe praised: The Harmonious Cosmic Rhythm</h3>
    <p>On a contemplative journey through the universe, we can sense that the regularity and harmony in the movement of celestial bodies is a kind of silent praise.</p>
    <p>The Qur'an refers to this cosmic praise:</p>
    <div class="box quran-box">
        “The seven heavens and the earth and whatever is in them exalt Him. And there is not a thing except that it exalts [Allah] by His praise, but you do not understand their [way of] exalting. Indeed, He is ever Forbearing and Forgiving.”<br>
        [Al-Israa: 44].
    </div>

    <p>A new study from the University of Oxford (2024) has suggested that levels of "primordial consciousness" may exist at different levels in the universe, from the smallest particles to the largest stars and galaxies.</p>

    <h2>The Unified Consciousness: From the Atom to the Galaxy in a Universe Praising God</h2>
    
    <h3>I: From Atom to Cell</h3>
    <p>The journey from consciousness at the atomic level to consciousness at the cellular level is not a leap, but a natural progression. A cell, at its core, is an organized arrangement of atoms and molecules, working together in an integrated system.</p>
    <div class="box quote-box">
        Dr. Bruce Lipton says in his book "The Biology of Belief": "I suddenly realized that the life of a cell is controlled by its physical and energetic environment, not its genes... The environment acts as a 'contractor' that reads and acts on these genetic blueprints."
    </div>

    <h3>II: From cell to organism</h3>
    <p>According to the latest estimates published by the <em>Annals of Human Biology</em> in 2023, the adult human body contains about 30 trillion cells, and each cell contains about 10 trillion atoms. How can so many cells work in perfect harmony to produce a single integrated entity with a unified consciousness?</p>
    <p>The theory of <strong>Quantum Brain Biology</strong> proposes that cells in an organism may be quantumly interconnected, allowing a unified consciousness to emerge at the level of the organism as a whole.</p>

    <h3>Third: From the Organism to the Universe</h3>
    <p>Could this quantum interconnectedness extend beyond the organism to the entire universe? Some physicists and philosophers think so. The "cosmic mind" theory suggests that the universe as a whole may have a kind of universal "consciousness" from which all other forms of consciousness emanate.</p>
    
    <div class="box science-box">
        Philosopher and physicist Bernardo Castrop says in his 2019 book <em>The Idea of the World</em>: "Consciousness may not be a local phenomenon emanating only from the human brain, but a fundamental cosmic property, like space, time, and energy."
    </div>

    <h3>IV: Toward a Unified Model of Consciousness</h3>
    <p>What I see today is an exciting convergence of science, philosophy, and spirituality in understanding consciousness. The Science of Consciousness Conference (TSC) in 2023 brought together experts from various fields. The exciting conclusion is that we may be on the cusp of a new paradigm of consciousness - one that sees consciousness as a fundamental property of the universe.</p>

    <p><strong>The harmony between the Qur'an and modern science in understanding cosmic consciousness</strong><br>
    It is truly astonishing to find a profound correspondence between what the Qur'an referred to more than fourteen centuries ago and what modern science has begun to explore about cosmic consciousness and the deep interconnectedness of the components of existence.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Future Research Prospects in the Field of Quantum Consciousness and Cosmic Interconnectedness</strong><br>
    We are on the brink of a revolution that blends science and philosophy. When I delved deeper into Penrose and Hameroff's "coordinated objective collapse" theory, I found it to be a real glimmer of hope for moving beyond a simplistic, mechanistic view of consciousness. Could the microtubules in our neurons really be the stage for the cosmic dances that produce our consciousness?</p>

    <h2>Chapter Six: Spiritual and Existential Reflections on a Universe Praising God</h2>
    <p>When we contemplate the reality of the swimming universe, deep spiritual and existential horizons open up before us, beyond the limits of abstract scientific knowledge to the realm of heartfelt and spiritual knowledge. The idea that every atom in this universe praises God and testifies to His oneness carries with it a profound message about the unity of existence in purpose and meaning.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Human means of sharing a symphony of praise with the universe</strong>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Praise with science and knowledge:</strong> True science is "thinking God's thoughts."</li>
        <li><strong>Praise through creativity and beauty:</strong> Authentic art reflects something of the Creator's beauty.</li>
        <li><strong>Praise with good deeds:</strong> When we fill the earth with goodness, we participate in the praise of the universe.</li>
        <li><strong>Tasbih with meditation and presence:</strong> Mindful meditation is one of the most profound forms of praise.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>A summary of the journey from the atom to the galaxy</h2>
    <p>In our scientific and contemplative journey from the atom to the galaxy, we witnessed amazing manifestations of consciousness and praise at all levels of existence:
    <ul>
        <li><strong>At the level of the atom:</strong> Amazing precision in design and behavior that resembles a conscious being.</li>
        <li><strong>At the cellular level:</strong> An integrated system that operates with superior intelligence and altruistic behavior.</li>
        <li><strong>At the level of the universe:</strong> Amazing order in the movement of celestial bodies and miraculous balance.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p><strong>The Integration of Science and Faith</strong><br>
    Our journey confirms that true science does not conflict with true faith, but rather enhances and supports it. The deeper we understand the universe and its secrets, the more we believe in the greatness and wisdom of the Creator.</p>

        "We will show them Our signs in the horizons and in themselves until it becomes clear to them that it is the truth"<br>
        [Faslat: 53]
    </div>

    <p>From the infinitesimal atom to the sprawling galaxy, the universe plays a harmonious symphony of praise and reverence for the Almighty. Perhaps the greatest lesson we learn from this journey is to join - consciously and willingly - in this renewed cosmic symphony, and to make our whole life a praise to God.</p>
