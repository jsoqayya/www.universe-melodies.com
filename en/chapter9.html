    <h1>Chapter Nine<br>The Scientific Perspective of the Conscious Universe</h1>

    <div class="box desc-box">
        <strong>Chapter description:</strong> This chapter provides a comprehensive view of how the scientific understanding of consciousness has evolved from a limited biological property to a fundamental cosmic principle that may be the essence of existence itself. The chapter begins by posing the deeper existential question about the nature of consciousness in the universe, showing how modern scientific theories have dared to propose what was previously considered the province of philosophy and religion. The chapter examines groundbreaking theories such as Robert Lanza's biocentrism, which overturns the traditional understanding by making consciousness the origin rather than the product of the universe; the theory of universal consciousness, which sees consciousness as a property present in everything from electrons to galaxies; and integrated information theory, which attempts to develop a mathematical formula for measuring consciousness. The chapter also explores the role of quantum physics in demonstrating that conscious observation affects the behavior of matter itself, suggesting a fundamental role for consciousness in shaping reality. The chapter concludes with the surprising convergence between these contemporary scientific theories and the Qur'anic vision of the universe as a conscious creature praising God, opening new horizons for dialogue between science and faith in understanding the nature of existence and cosmic consciousness.

    <h2>Introduction: Science and Cosmic Consciousness</h2>
    <p>Throughout this vast universe, where stars dwell like candles in an endless night, and where galaxies wander in the stillness of space-time, an old and renewed question arises in man: Are we the only beings with consciousness? Is our feeling and perception of life just an exception in a silent world? Or is the entire universe pulsating with consciousness, interacting with us and sharing the journey of understanding and realization with us?</p>
    
    <p>In previous chapters, we have considered the Qur'anic vision that depicts the universe as a conscious being, praising and expressing its awareness and connection to its Creator. Now, in this chapter, we will travel together to the arena of modern science, where some theories are beginning to dare to propose what has long been the province of philosophy and religion: that consciousness is not just a side effect, but an intrinsic part of the fabric of existence.</p>

    <p>I remember well that distant night... I was sixteen years old, lying on the roof of our country house, watching the stars. The sky was clear and the stars were countless, and suddenly I felt a strange sensation - that I was not alone in this vast universe. This experience may seem silly to many, but it opened up questions for me: Are we really alone? Are these stars and galaxies just inanimate objects floating in space, or are they teeming with their own life and consciousness?</p>

    <p>Honestly, I'll be the first to admit that it's a very thorny subject - it intersecting at the crossroads of science, philosophy and faith. But what really struck me the more I dug deeper... is that contemporary science is getting unexpectedly close to an idea that has long been considered a metaphysical fantasy - the idea that the universe might be conscious in some way.</p>

    <div class="image-placeholder">
        [Image Description: Deep cosmic darkness and human wonder: In the heart of the infinite darkness of the universe, stars are scattered like faint candles, while man stands small before the grandeur of existence, wondering about the secret of his own consciousness in this vast creation. A thin thread of light stretches towards him, symbolizing hope and the quest to understand the deeper meaning of existence.]
    </div>

    <p>The universe appears as a vast network of interwoven threads of light, connecting planets, stars, and galaxies. It appears not as a rigid physical body, but as a living organism pulsating with consciousness and thought, expressing the idea that matter is but an image of the cosmic mind flowing with life.</p>

    <div class="box quote-box">
        The famous British physicist Arthur Eddington wrote a century ago:<br>
        "The matter of the universe is the matter of the mind" (Eddington, 1928, p. 276)
    </div>

    <p>In his 1928 book <em>The Nature of the Physical World</em>, Eddington wrote: "The universe is of the nature of thought or sensation in a cosmic mind... To express the conclusion simplistically - the substance of the world is the substance of the mind."</p>

    <p>In this context, Eddington points out that the basis of reality is not purely physical, but has a mental or mental character. He adds: "The mind-stuff of the world is, of course, something more general than our individual conscious minds." In other words, the "mind-stuff" he is talking about goes beyond individual consciousness and refers to a more general mental existence that encompasses the entire universe.</p>
    
    <p>These quotes show that Eddington sees mind or consciousness as the true basis of reality, not physical matter. I often wondered, how did Eddington feel when he coined this revolutionary phrase? After decades of science believing that the universe is a deaf machine that operates according to purely mechanical laws, and that consciousness is a byproduct of brain processes... Eddington turned the tables, suggesting that the opposite might be true!</p>

    <p>Eddington was not a passing voice; his words opened a wide door for scientific and philosophical debate, a door that is still open today, as he raised the possibility that consciousness is the deep structure of reality, not just a secondary phenomenon.</p>

    <div class="box quote-box">
        The physicist David Bohm went even further when he said:<br>
        "Consciousness is an internal relationship with the whole; we internalize the whole and act toward it. What we perceive essentially determines what we are."
    </div>

    <p>This quote reflects Bohm's view of consciousness as an internal and holistic relationship with the whole, where consciousness is an integral part of total reality, not just a phenomenon confined to the brain. Bohm also points out that consciousness and matter are not separate essences, but rather different aspects of an unbroken holistic movement:</p>

    <div class="box quote-box">
        "In this flow, mind and matter are not separate essences. They are different aspects of our total and uninterrupted movement."<br>
        (David Bohm, Wholeness and the Implicate Order (1980), p. 132)
    </div>

    <p>These ideas, which in the past seemed more like mysticism than science, are now beginning to find resonance in quantum physics, neuroscience, and philosophy of mind. They unknowingly converge with the view expressed centuries ago in the Qur'an: That everything in the universe is conscious, alive in spirit, interacting, witnessing, and praising.</p>

    <div class="box quran-box">
        The Almighty says: "The seven heavens and the earth and whatever is in them exalt Him. And there is not a thing except that it exalts [Allah] by His praise, but you do not understand their [way of] exalting. Indeed, He is ever Forbearing and Forgiving." [Al-Israa: 44]
    </div>

    <p>In the coming pages, we will trace the most prominent scientific theories that deal with the consciousness of the universe, and we will compare what these theories say with what the Qur'an told us more than fourteen centuries ago. We will see how science is beginning to reach out to faith, so that they can meet at the gateway to a deeper understanding of the nature of the universe.</p>

    <div class="image-placeholder">
        [Image Description: "The Brain within Cosmic Consciousness" (David Boehm's vision): In this symbolic scene, the human brain appears as a translucent object suspended in luminous space, through which filaments of cosmic light pass. Surrounded by galaxies and stars, it is as if the human mind is not separate from the universe but is part of its infinite fabric, living within the great sea of cosmic consciousness]

    <p><strong>A violent collision with our materialistic understanding of the universe</strong></p>
    <p>When I started researching this field, I came across a theory that changed my understanding of reality. Imagine one of America's leading stem cell scientists proposing that consciousness precedes matter! Yes, not a mystical philosopher, but a renowned biologist named Robert Lanza.</p>
    <p>I remember well the moment I first read the theory... The shock was so strong that I pondered its meaning for hours.</p>

    <div class="box theory-box">
        The theory says simply, and amazingly boldly, "Consciousness is the origin of the universe, not matter!"
    </div>

    <p>Biocentrism offers a different take on traditional conceptualizations in physics and cosmology. Rather than seeing consciousness as a product of the universe, this theory sees consciousness as the foundation from which the universe emerges. In other words, the universe does not exist independently of consciousness, but is shaped and perceived through it.</p>

    <p>In his book <em>Biocentrism: How Life and Consciousness are the Keys to Understanding the True Nature of the Universe</em>, Lanza explains this idea:</p>
    <div class="box quote-box">
        "Consciousness came first... Matter, time and space are just tools that our consciousness uses to understand reality."<br>
        He adds: "The universe does not exist independently of life and consciousness; rather, life precedes the universe, not the other way around."
    </div>

    <p>I know this is hard to believe at first glance... But bear with me for a moment. The theory is based on the idea that consciousness exists first, and the universe exists only because it is observed. Even the behavior of subatomic particles, as proven by scientific experiments, depends on the presence of the observer.</p>

    <p>As such, biocentrism challenges the foundations of the classical scientific paradigm; it shifts priorities:
    <br>- Consciousness is not a product of the universe.
    <br>- It is the universe that emerges from consciousness</p>

    <p>As Lanza writes: "Any universe that could have preceded consciousness existed only in a potential state." He adds: "Consciousness came first... Matter, time and space are just tools our consciousness uses to make sense of reality." (Robert Lanza, Biocentrism: How Life and Consciousness are the Keys to Understanding the True Nature of the Universe, 2010)</p>

    <p>I remember my discussion with my doctor friend (who usually approaches the world with strict logic). He laughed sarcastically when I told him about the theory, and said, "So your brain predates the universe?" I replied with a smile: "No, man! It's not my brain or your brain, it's a cosmic consciousness that is wider and deeper than our limited minds!"</p>

    <div class="box theory-box">
        An electron behaves as a wave when not observed, and as a particle when observed. In other words, the presence of the observer determines how matter behaves!
    </div>

    <p>The double-slit experiment is a fundamental experiment in quantum mechanics, showing that the behavior of particles (such as electrons or photons) can change depending on whether a measurement (or "observation") is made to determine the particle's trajectory. When the trajectory is not measured, the particles show an interference pattern indicating wave behavior. When the trajectory is measured, the interference pattern disappears, indicating particle behavior.</p>

    <p>So sometimes, I seriously wonder: What if science is unknowingly walking towards meeting faith halfway? Perhaps we are on the cusp of the greatest epistemological revolution in human history...</p>

Every star shines like a witness to the "Be" moment, and every galaxy proceeds in a dance of cosmic obedience. Not just an image of space, but a visual manifestation that illuminated nothingness with consciousness and existence. This radiant center represents the cosmic consciousness, which was not just a part of the universe, but the origin and structure of its existence, as the theory of biocentrism says: Consciousness first, then the universe.]
    </div>

    <h3>The main pillars of the theory</h3>
    <p>Biocentrism is based on a set of principles that redefine our relationship to time, space, and the universe around us:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Consciousness precedes the universe:</strong> Lanza emphasizes that consciousness is not a product of the universe, but rather the foundation from which the universe emerges. In his article "A New Theory of the Universe," he explains: <em>"Instead of postulating a reality that precedes and creates life, we propose a life-centered perspective. From this perspective, life-especially consciousness-creates the universe, and the universe cannot exist without us."</em></li>
        
        <li><strong>Time and Space are tools of the mind:</strong> According to Lanza, time and space are not independent physical entities, but rather a creation of the mind to organize experience. In his article "Time Might Only Exist in Our Heads," Robert Lanza states: <em>"Time is simply the ordered construction of what we observe in space-just like movie frames-that occurs within the mind."</em> This suggests that our perception of time and space depends on our consciousness, not their independent existence.</li>

        <li><strong>Observation Creates Reality:</strong> Quantum mechanics experiments, such as the double-slit experiment, suggest that the behavior of tiny particles changes depending on the presence of the observer. Lanza explains that consciousness determines reality. In his article "A New Theory of the Universe," he explains: <em>"Instead of postulating a reality that precedes and creates life, we propose a life-centered conception. From this perspective, life-especially consciousness-creates the universe, and the universe cannot exist without us."</em></li>

        <li><strong>The universe is preset for life:</strong> The precision of physical fine-tuning in the constants of the universe suggests that it is not the product of random chance, but rather as if life was an original goal from the beginning, not just an accidental consequence.</li>

        <li><strong>Death does not mean the end of consciousness:</strong> As long as time and space are related to consciousness, and not the other way around, the demise of the body does not necessarily mean the demise of consciousness. Consciousness, according to Lanza, is an essence that precedes and continues after matter.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="box quote-box">
        "Biocentrism takes the reader on a seemingly improbable but ultimately inevitable journey through an alien universe-our universe-from the perspectives of a renowned biologist and a leading astronomer. This journey will change the reader's ideas about life, time, space, and even death... The reader will never see reality in the same way again."
    </div>

    <h3>Scientific Evidence for Biocentrism</h3>
    <p>The theory of biocentrism is based on several scientific evidences, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>The double-slit experiment:</strong> This famous experiment in quantum physics shows that electrons and photons behave like a wave when unobserved and like a particle when observed. In physicist John Wheeler's "delayed choice" experiment, the observer's decision of how to measure a particle can affect its behavior even after the phenomenon has occurred, suggesting that consciousness plays a fundamental role in determining the behavior of matter, and that time itself may be a relative concept that depends on perception. (Wheeler, J. A., "Law Without Law", in Quantum Theory and Measurement, Princeton University Press (1983), pp. 182-213)</li>
        
        <li><strong>Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle:</strong> This principle in quantum physics states that it is impossible to measure the position and momentum of a subatomic particle with complete accuracy at the same time. This suggests that reality is not absolutely determined, but depends to some degree on the process of observation. (Heisenberg, W., "Physics and Philosophy: The Revolution in Modern Science", Harper Perennial Modern Classics (2007), pp. 42-58)</li>
        
        <li><strong>The principle of quantum entanglement:</strong> This principle suggests that subatomic particles can be quantum "entangled", so that measuring the state of one immediately affects the state of the other, regardless of the distance between them. This challenges our traditional concept of space and time, and points to a deeper interconnectedness between everything in the universe. (Aspect, A., Dalibard, J., & Roger, G., "Experimental Test of Bell's Inequalities Using Time-Varying Analyzers", Physical Review Letters (1982), 49(25), 1804-1807)</li>
        
        <li><strong>Man's Cosmic Principle:</strong> This principle suggests that the physical constants in the universe are finely tuned to allow for the existence of life. If the force of gravity were a tiny bit weaker or stronger, stars and galaxies would not form. If the strong nuclear force were even slightly weaker, the nuclei of atoms would not hold together. This astonishing precision suggests that life is not just an accidental consequence of physical laws, but may be intrinsic to the universe. (Davies, P., "The Goldilocks Enigma: Why Is the Universe Just Right for Life?", Mariner Books (2008), pp. 120-145)</li>

    </div>

    <p><strong>More recent developments in the theory</strong></p>
    <p>In his later work, notably in <em>Beyond Biocentrism: Rethinking Time, Space, Consciousness, and the Illusion of Death</em> (2016), Robert Lanza expanded his theory of biocentrism to relate it directly to concepts from quantum mechanics. Lanza suggests that consciousness is not limited to complex organisms like humans, but is a fundamental property of the universe at the quantum level. He argues that subatomic particles may possess a primitive form of consciousness, which explains their mysterious behavior in quantum experiments, such as quantum entanglement and quantum superposition.</p>
    
    <p>These ideas show that Lanza tended to see consciousness as part of a deeper, more comprehensive whole, where consciousness and matter are intertwined in a continuous holistic movement. Lanza also suggests that human consciousness is part of a vast network of cosmic consciousness, and that our subjective experience of consciousness is just a small window into this wider cosmic consciousness. (Lanza, R., & Berman, B., Beyond Biocentrism: Rethinking Time, Space, Consciousness, and the Illusion of Death (2021), pp. 88-103)</p>
    
    <p>This is remarkably consistent with the Qur'anic conceptualization of the universe as a conscious and aware creature that praises God and submits to his command.</p>

    <h3>Biocentrism's compatibility with the Qur'anic conceptualization of a conscious universe</h3>
    <p>The theory of biocentrism is compatible with the Qur'anic conception of a conscious universe in several aspects:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>The centrality of consciousness:</strong> Biocentrism proposes that consciousness is the basis of existence, and this is consistent with the Qur'anic conceptualization of the universe as a conscious, aware creature that praises and submits to God.
            <div class="box quran-box">"There is nothing but praise, but you do not understand their praise" [Al-Israa: 44].</div>
        </li>
        <li><strong>The teleology of creation:</strong> The theory of biocentrism suggests that the universe is precisely designed for life, and this is consistent with the Qur'anic conceptualization of the universe as an elaborate creation of an expert sage who created it for a purpose and goal.
            <div class="box quran-box">"We have not created the heavens and the earth and what is between them except for truth" [Al-Hajar: 85].</div>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Continuity of consciousness after death:</strong> Biocentrism suggests that consciousness does not end with the death of the physical body, and this is consistent with the Islamic conceptualization of life after death.
            <div class="box quran-box">And do not think that those who are killed in the way of Allah are dead, but that they are alive with their Lord [Al-Imran 169].</div>
        </li>
        <li><strong>The role of observation in shaping reality:</strong> Biocentrism theory suggests that observation plays a role in shaping reality, and this is consistent with the Qur'anic conceptualization of man as a caliph on earth, with a role in shaping his reality.
            <div class="box quran-box">"I am a Caliph in the earth" [Al-Baqarah: 30].</div>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Research II: Panpsychism</h2>
    
    <div class="box theory-box">
        This theory goes far beyond what the conventional mind can imagine: According to this theory, consciousness is not an exclusive property of evolved organisms, but rather a fundamental property found in everything in the universe. In other words, every bit of matter, from electrons to mountains, has some kind of consciousness or subjective experience, albeit a very primitive one. This is not to say that electrons "think" or "feel" as we do, but that they have a simple form of subjective experience.
    </div>

    <p>Yes, everything - even the smallest physical particles. At first glance, the idea seems shocking: That rocks have some kind of perception? That electrons "feel" something? But when you consider the philosophical roots of this theory, you find that it's as old as the philosophers of Greece and ancient Eastern civilizations. Today, it is returning to the scene with scientific and philosophical questions unanswered by traditional materialist theories.</p>

    <p><strong>Why is this theory being revisited today?</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>The Hard Problem of Consciousness:</strong> Philosopher David Chalmers points out that there is a "hard problem" in understanding how subjective experience arises from physical processes in the brain.</li>
        <li><strong>The shortcomings of materialist explanations:</strong> Traditional materialist explanations have difficulty explaining how physical processes can produce consciousness.</li>
        <li><strong>Renewed interest in philosophy and science:</strong> The 21st century is witnessing a growing interest in the theory of holistic consciousness, which is seen as an alternative framework for understanding consciousness.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I remember well one winter night, when I was immersed in a reading about universal consciousness. I started talking to myself out loud without realizing it! I suddenly walked in on my wife, and she asked me if I was talking to someone on the phone! Lest you go crazy, The theory of Universal Consciousness simply says: Consciousness is present in everything. Not a complex human consciousness, of course, but a simple, primitive type of cognition that corresponds to the nature of the existing entity. Imagine: an electron has some sort of simple perception, an atom does, and maybe even the chair you're sitting in right now!</p>

    <p>To be honest, I hesitated a lot before writing this chapter, fearing that the idea would sound like scientific heresy. But I was encouraged by the fact that big scientific and philosophical names are beginning to embrace this view.</p>

    <p><strong>Why does philosophy need a theory of universal consciousness?</strong> Personally, I find it a bit like trying to explain love with only chemical equations: Yes, we can describe the hormones responsible for love, but do these hormones explain the essence of the experience of love?</p>

    <p>I remember once I was discussing this with an anesthesiologist, and he said to me nervously: "That's nonsense! Consciousness is a product of the brain, we just don't understand it yet." I calmly asked him: "What if the issue is that the question itself is wrong from the beginning?"</p>

    <p>To my surprise, the eminent neuroscientist <strong>Christoph Koch</strong>, who has long been a champion of materialism, has recently announced his inclination to embrace the theory of universal consciousness! This is like one of the greatest astronomers abandoning the sphericity of the earth to embrace the flat earth theory! A Sudden Shift, Shocking to Many.</p>

    <div class="box quote-box">
        In a 2013 interview with Wired magazine, Koch stated:<br>
        "I think we live in a universe composed of space, time, mass, energy, and consciousness arising from complex systems." He also explained that this conceptualization is the "most satisfying explanation of the universe" for him.
    </div>

    <p>In <em>The Feeling of Life Itself</em> (2019), Koch describes consciousness as "the feeling of being alive," and emphasizes that consciousness cannot be simulated by computers, because it is not just some kind of calculation, but an "ontological state". This shift in Koch's position is shocking to some, given his prominent position in the field of neuroscience, and reflects the ongoing challenges in understanding the nature of consciousness.</p>

    <div class="image-placeholder">
        [Image Description: Panpsychism: Everything in the universe shines with subtle points of light: Rocks, trees, mountains, even the depths of the oceans and stars all radiate an inner pulse of consciousness. It suggests that life is not limited to visible beings, but that every atom in this existence participates in the story of consciousness and subtle existence.]
    </div>

    <p>I'm not advocating blind faith here. In fact, I confess that I still oscillate between questioning, searching, and skepticism when it comes to the theory of mass consciousness. But it's still worth considering, isn't it?</p>

    <h3>The Intellectual Foundations of Panpsychism</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Consciousness as a fundamental property of the universe:</strong> The theory says that consciousness is not a product of biological or neurological complexity, but an intrinsic part of the fabric of existence, like gravity or mass.</li>
        <li><strong>Consciousness is present in everything:</strong> Every entity in the universe, from an electron to a tree, has some degree of consciousness commensurate with the nature of its existence. Not necessarily a thinking consciousness, but a primitive sense of existence.</li>
        <li><strong>Consciousness is irreducible:</strong> No matter how much we study neurons and the brain, there will still be an explanatory gap, because physical processes alone cannot explain subjective experiences.</li>
        <li><strong>Evolution of consciousness:</strong> The theory accepts that human consciousness is more complex than animal consciousness, and animal consciousness is more evolved than plant consciousness, but the essence is the same: Consciousness is originally present and evolves over time.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="box quote-box">
        As David Chalmers writes:<br>
        "If consciousness is an essential element of reality, it is logical to assume that it exists everywhere, to varying degrees." (Chalmers, 1996)
    </div>

    <h3>Philosophical and Scientific Evidence Supporting Panpsychism</h3>
    <p>In his famous article "Facing Up to the Problem of Consciousness" (1995), philosopher David Chalmers made a distinction between the "easy issues" of consciousness, such as explaining behaviors and neurological functions, and the "hard issue," explaining how and why physical processes in the brain produce subjective experience or "qualia." (Chalmers, D., "Facing Up to the Problem of Consciousness," Journal of Consciousness Studies, 1995).</p>
    
    <p>If consciousness is just a physical evolution, when and where did it suddenly appear? Proponents of universal consciousness argue that it did not suddenly appear, but has existed since time immemorial, evolving gradually. (Skrbina, D., "Panpsychism in the West", MIT Press, 2007)</p>
    
    <p>Emphasizes that neuroscience, no matter how advanced, cannot explain how and why neural processes produce subjective experience. (Nagel, T., "What is it like to be a bat?", 1974). In his essay "What Is It Like to Be a Bat?" (1974), Thomas Nagel argues that subjective experience (qualia) cannot be reduced to purely physical explanations, suggesting that there is an explanatory gap between physical processes and conscious experience.</p>

    <h3>Recent Developments in the Theory of Universal Consciousness</h3>
    <p>In recent years, the theory of universal consciousness has undergone remarkable developments, driven by contributions from leading philosophers and neuroscientists, and has become part of a broader global debate about the nature of consciousness. Among the most notable shifts has been the philosophical shift made by the renowned neuroscientist Christoph Koch. Koch, previously a leading advocate of a materialist explanation of consciousness, surprised the scientific community when he announced that he was open to the idea that consciousness is not exclusive to complex organisms, but may be present in everything to varying degrees.</p>
    
    <p>New models and theories have emerged that expand on this idea, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>"Analytic Universal Consciousness"</strong> by David Chalmers, which aims to provide a more nuanced logical and philosophical formulation of the concept of pervasive consciousness.</li>
        <li><strong>"Formal Universal Consciousness"</strong> Developed by philosopher Philip Gough, it proposes that consciousness is the fundamental internal structure of the universe, just as mass is a fundamental property of matter.</li>
        <li><strong>Quantum Panpsychism:</strong> Some scientists have linked the theory of universal consciousness with quantum physics, suggesting that subatomic particles not only possess quantum properties, but may also carry a primordial consciousness.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="box quote-box">
        "In his later works such as Science, Order, and Creativity (1987), David Bohm explains that 'consciousness is more a part of the underlying order than matter... However, at a deeper level, [matter and consciousness] are inseparable and intertwined.'"
    </div>

    <h3>The Compatibility of the Theory of Universal Consciousness with the Qur'anic Conceptualization of a Conscious Universe</h3>
    <p>The amazing thing about this theory is that it is fundamentally compatible with the Qur'anic view of the universe, which sees everything in existence as praising God in its own way and possessing some kind of consciousness.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>The consciousness of everything:</strong> Consciousness, according to the theory, is an attribute present in everything that exists, and this is in harmony with the Qur'anic conceptualization of the universe as a living, conscious entity that praises and glorifies its Creator.
            <div class="box quran-box">"The seven heavens, the earth, and whoever is in them praise Him, and there is nothing but praise in His praise, but you do not understand their praise" [Al-Israa: 44]</div>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Varying degrees of consciousness:</strong> The theory holds that the electron's consciousness is not the same as human consciousness, and that there is a gradation in degrees of realization. This is consistent with the gradation of the ranks of creatures in the Qur'an.
            <div class="box quran-box">"Have you not seen that those in the heavens and those in the earth, the sun, the moon, the stars, the mountains, the trees, the animals, and many of the people prostrate to Him" [Al-Hajj: 18].</div>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Originality of consciousness:</strong> The theory emphasizes that consciousness does not emerge from matter, but is an intrinsic property. This parallels the Qur'anic conceptualization of consciousness as an element inherent in creatures since God created them.</li>
        <li><strong>Unity of Being in Diversity:</strong> The theory holds that consciousness unites all the elements of the universe, despite their different forms. The Qur'an depicts the universe as a harmonious and homogeneous unit, praising God.
            <div class="box quran-box">"To Allah belongs what is in the heavens and what is in the earth, and the angels, and they are not arrogant" [Al-Nahl: 49].</div>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <div class="box quote-box">
        Dr. Ahmed Shawky Ibrahim says in his book Praise of the Universe:<br>
        "Praising God is the nature of creation. Every creature is innately and compulsively made to praise God, and if it stopped praising God, it would perish and end up in nothingness, and every atom in every creature is obedient and obedient to God's command and praises Him."<br>

    <h2>Research III: Integrated Information Theory</h2>
    <h3>(Integrated Information Theory - IIT)</h3>
    <p><strong>When consciousness is measured is measured by information!</strong></p>
    <p>After reviewing the theories of biocentrism and holistic consciousness, which addressed the relationship between consciousness and matter from a philosophical and spiritual angle, we now turn to a more scientific and empirical approach: Integrated Information Theory, or IIT for short.</p>
    
    <p>What characterizes this theory? It attempts to mathematize consciousness! Yes, imagine consciousness being calculated as a number, and measured as accurately as any other physical measurement! Italian neuroscientist Giulio Tononi proposed the theory as a framework for explaining consciousness by integrating the information processed by any complex system.</p>

    <p><strong>The most notable feature of Integrated Information Theory:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Starting from the experience of consciousness itself:</strong> IIT starts from the basic premise that consciousness exists as a direct, undeniable fact. From this point, the theory defines five "axioms" that describe the intrinsic properties of any conscious experience: Intrinsicality, Information, Integration, Exclusion, Composition.</li>
        <li><strong>Linking Consciousness to the Causal Structure of the System:</strong> IIT posits that consciousness corresponds to a specific causal structure within a physical system, known as the Phi structure. This structure represents the indivisible interaction between the components of the system and is measured by Φ (Phi), which reflects the degree of information integration within the system.</li>
        <li><strong>Applicability to different systems:</strong> IIT distinguishes between systems that have varying degrees of consciousness, based on the amount of Φ. For example, the human brain is thought to have a high Φ, while simple systems or electronic devices are thought to have low or no Φ, indicating the absence of consciousness.</li>
        <li><strong>Introducing a mathematical framework for measuring consciousness:</strong> IIT provides a mathematical framework that allows, in principle, to determine whether a given system is conscious, measure its degree of consciousness, and characterize the nature of its conscious experience. This framework is based on analyzing the causal structure of the system and determining the magnitude of Φ.</li>
        <li><strong>Generating controversy and scientific interest:</strong> Although IIT is supported by some scientists, such as Christoph Koch, it also faces criticism, especially regarding its difficulty in being empirically tested, and its interpretation of consciousness as a fundamental property of the universe, approaching the concepts of "cosmic consciousness" or "universal consciousness".</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Integral information theory is a serious attempt to understand consciousness from a scientific and objective perspective, by linking subjective experience to the physical structure of the system. Despite its challenges, it opens up new avenues for research into the nature of consciousness and its applications in fields such as neuroscience, artificial intelligence, and philosophy.</p>

    <p>As an anesthesiologist, I practice this idea every day: I use devices like the Masimo SedLine, which measures a patient's state of consciousness during anesthesia via an index known as PSI - Patient State Index. This index monitors brain activity to determine the depth of anesthesia: Between 25 and 50: Deep sleep and sufficient loss of consciousness. 50 to 70: Beginning to regain consciousness.</p>

    <p>But what really intrigued me about Tononi's theory is that it's not limited to the human brain. Rather, it says: Any system that integrally processes information - even a computer or a robot - may have consciousness to some degree!</p>

    <div class="box quote-box">
        Written by Giulio Tononi:<br>
        "According to integrated information theory, consciousness is a property of complex physical systems that process information integrally. Consciousness is not exclusive to the human brain, but can be found in any system with a sufficient degree of information integration."<br>
        (Giulio Tononi, "Consciousness as Integrated Information: A Provisional Manifesto", Biological Bulletin, 2008)
    </div>

    <p>I remember asking my 18-year-old, AI-obsessed son: "Do you think a computer can become conscious?" He answered immediately: "Sure, just a matter of time!" I asked him: "But how will we know if it's already conscious?" He thought for a while and then said, "We'll never know for sure!" And therein lies the profound paradox: Can something as subjective as consciousness be measured?</p>

    <h3>The Essence of Integrated Information Theory (IIT)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Consciousness equals indivisible integrated information:</strong> Every conscious experience is one integrated unit. When you see a rose, you don't perceive the color, shape, and smell individually, but as an integrated experience. This integration, according to the theory, is what makes "consciousness".</li>
        <li><strong>Any integrated system can be conscious:</strong> It doesn't have to be biological consciousness. Any system, even an electronic one, if it processes information in an integrated way, can have consciousness.</li>
        <li><strong>Consciousness has form and structure (Qualia):</strong> Consciousness is not just a "quantity" of information, it also has a "quality" - a subjective experience: Like feeling pain, tasting coffee, or seeing the color red.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Scientific evidence for IIT theory</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Neuroimaging studies:</strong> show that the integration of information in the brain is reduced in states such as deep sleep or coma, which corresponds to a reduced level of consciousness. (Massimini, M., et al., "Breakdown of Cortical Effective Connectivity During Sleep", Science, 2005)</li>
        <li><strong>Perceptual studies:</strong> When a person is conscious, the brain shows patterns of integrated activity between several regions, and these patterns disappear when consciousness is lost. (Dehaene, S., et al., "Toward a Computational Theory of Conscious Processing", Current Opinion in Neurobiology, 2014). It suggests that our brain does not treat sensory signals as parts, but as a unified experience - just as IIT posits. (Baars, B. J., "The Conscious Access Hypothesis", Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 2002)</li>
        <li><strong>Studying trance states:</strong> In a groundbreaking study published in 2019, a team led by Adrian Owen used the Faye scale to assess comatose patients, and found that the scale can distinguish between consciousness and unconsciousness even when no outward signs are present. (Owen, A., et al., "Detecting Consciousness", Annual Review of Psychology, 2017)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Tononi developed a more advanced version of his theory: IIT 3.0, with which he designed a new tool known as the "Response Complexity Index" (PCI). The PCI is based on magnetically stimulating the brain and measuring its response. In a study published in Science Translational Medicine in 2020, PCI showed unprecedented accuracy in measuring levels of consciousness in patients who appeared to be completely absent from reality.</p>
    <p>In 2022, Nature Neuroscience published a study proposing to extend IIT to non-human systems, such as artificial intelligence and artificial neural networks, opening the door to a whole new science: Comparative Consciousness Science.</p>

    <h3>The compatibility of the IIT theory with the Qur'anic conceptualization of a conscious universe</h3>
    <p>Despite the empirical scientific nature of the theory, there are interesting parallels with the Qur'anic vision:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Integration of consciousness:</strong> The theory suggests that consciousness arises from the integration of information. The Qur'an also depicts the universe as an integrated and harmonious system.
            <div class="box quran-box">The Qur'an says: "What you see in the creation of the Most Merciful is no difference" [Al-Malik: 3]</div>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Different degrees of consciousness:</strong> IIT says that consciousness varies according to the amount of integrated information. The Qur'an emphasizes the disparity of creatures in worship and realization.
            <div class="box quran-box">The Almighty says: "There is nothing except that we have the stores of it, and we do not bring it down except by a known amount" [Al-Hajar: 21]</div>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Structure of consciousness:</strong> Consciousness in IIT has form and structure. The Qur'an also emphasizes that everything is created with perfection and a specific structure.
            <div class="box quran-box">The Almighty says: "He who has perfected everything He has created" [Al-Sajdah: 7].</div>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Originality of consciousness:</strong> The theory proposes that consciousness is not contingent, but rather the result of fundamental properties in complex systems, which is consistent with the Qur'anic concept of consciousness as an intrinsic element in God's creation.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>The Qur'anic vision of the universe offers an integrated conceptualization that combines matter and consciousness, and sees the universe as a harmonious unity, which is consistent with modern scientific theories that see consciousness as a fundamental property that arises from the integration of information.</p>

    <h2>Fourth article: Quantum Physics and Consciousness</h2>
    <p>When I first read into the world of quantum physics, I felt like I was reading not a science book, but a magical novel! This wondrous world, where a particle can be in two places at the same time, where the same observation changes the behavior of matter, and where time sometimes seems like an illusion... It opened doors for me that I never imagined existed.</p>
    
    <p>I remember well when I sat down with my university physics professor after a lecture and excitedly asked him about the double-slit experiment. He smiled wryly and said, "If you think you understand quantum physics... you haven't understood it yet!" This is when I realized that quantum physics is not just a science, but a gateway to the depths of existence itself, and to the secrets of the relationship between consciousness and matter.</p>

    <h3>Basic Principles of Quantum Physics and its Relationship to Consciousness</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle:</strong> Formulated by German physicist Werner Heisenberg in 1927, it states that the position and velocity of a subatomic particle cannot be measured with absolute precision simultaneously. The more accurate the position measurement, the less accurate the velocity measurement, and vice versa. This simply means that quantum reality is not absolutely determined prior to measurement, but depends on how it is observed. (Heisenberg, W., Physics and Beyond: Encounters and Conversations, Harper & Row, 1971, pp. 83-91)</li>
        
        <li><strong>Quantum Superposition:</strong> It states that particles can exist in several possible states at the same time, until they are observed and the superposition collapses into a single state. This is the secret to the famous double-slit experiment: An electron goes through two slits simultaneously, until it is observed, and then it only takes one of the two paths! (Schrödinger, E., "Die gegenwärtige Situation in der Quantenmechanik", Naturwissenschaften, 1935)</li>
        
        <li><strong>Quantum Entanglement:</strong> If two quantum particles are entangled, measuring the state of one immediately affects the other, no matter how far apart they are, even if they are separated by galaxies! Einstein described this phenomenon as: "Spooky Action at a Distance." (Bell, J. S., "On the Einstein Podolsky Rosen Paradox", Physics, 1964)</li>
        
        <li><strong>Wave Function Collapse Principle:</strong> states that tiny particles (such as electrons) are in a state of "multiple possibilities" before observation - that is, they can be in several places or states at once, like a coin spinning in the air. But as soon as we try to observe or measure them, these possibilities immediately "collapse" into one specific state - just as a coin settles on one side when dropped, suggesting that the "act of observation itself" plays a role in determining a particle's reality.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Interpretations of Quantum Physics as it relates to consciousness</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>The Copenhagen Interpretation:</strong> Developed by Niels Bohr and Heisenberg, it states that quantum reality is only determined by observation. Before measurement, a particle exists in an indeterminate probabilistic state. (Bohr, N., "Discussions with Einstein on Epistemological Problems in Atomic Physics", 1949)</li>
        <li><strong>Many-Worlds Interpretation:</strong> Introduced by Hugh Everett, it assumes that each quantum possibility is realized in its own parallel universe. There is no collapse of the wave function, and the universe is constantly branching out into multiple universes. (Everett, H., "'Relative State' Formulation of Quantum Mechanics", Reviews of Modern Physics, 1957)</li>
        <li><strong>Orchestrated Objective Reduction (Orchestrated Objective Reduction - Orch OR):</strong> Proposed by Roger Penrose and Stuart Hameroff. They propose that quantum processes in brain cells (microtubules) are responsible for generating human consciousness. (Penrose, R., & Hameroff, S., "Consciousness in the Universe", Journal of Cosmology, 2011)</li>
        <li><strong>Quantum Information Interpretation:</strong> Developed by Anton Zeilinger and others, it proposes that quantum reality is essentially information, and observation creates reality by extracting this information.</li>
    </ol>

        [Image Description: Quantum physics and consciousness: Transparent quantum waves float in space, and when a luminous eye, symbolizing human consciousness, approaches, one of the waves collapses into a glowing particle, exemplifying the strange influence of the human mind on physical reality, according to the laws of quantum mechanics, where observation creates reality.]
    </div>

    <p><strong>Recent experiments support the role of the observer in shaping reality</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>The Delayed Choice Experiment:</strong> carried out by John Wheeler and confirmed that an observer's decision on how to measure a particle can affect its behavior even after it has passed through the apparatus! (Wheeler, J. A., 1983)</li>
        <li><strong>Quantum Delayed Choice Experiment:</strong> carried out at the University of Tokyo in 2019, led by Masasami Sasaki, showed that even quantum entanglement can be subject to observer choice after the fact!</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Quantum Physics Opens the Door to a Conscious Universe</strong></p>
    <p>Quantum physics is one of the most controversial branches of science, especially when it intersects with the concepts of consciousness and perception. Some interpretations show that consciousness may not just be a biological phenomenon, but an essential part of the fabric of reality itself.</p>

    <div class="box quote-box">
        Max Planck: Consciousness as the foundation of reality<br>
        Planck said: "I consider consciousness to be fundamental. I consider matter to be derived from consciousness. We cannot go beyond consciousness. Everything we talk about, everything we consider to exist, presupposes consciousness."<br>
        (Max Planck, "The Observer," 1931)
    </div>

    <p><strong>Roger Penrose and Stuart Hameroff: The theory of "Orchestrated Objective Reduction"</strong></p>
    <p>Physicist Roger Penrose and anesthesiologist Stuart Hameroff proposed the theory of Orchestrated Objective Reduction (Orch OR): It posits that consciousness arises from quantum processes within neurons, specifically in microstructures known as microtubules. This theory combines concepts from quantum physics and neuroscience to explain consciousness as a phenomenon resulting from non-computable quantum processes.</p>

    <p><strong>David Bohm: Implicit order and undivided reality</strong></p>
    <p>who sees reality as consisting of an undivided system where matter and consciousness overlap. According to Bohm, what we see as tangible reality are just "manifestations" of a deeper, more integrated system.</p>

    <div class="box quote-box">
        Erwin Schrödinger: Unity of consciousness<br>
        Schrödinger said: "Consciousness cannot be explained in physical terms. For me, consciousness is the foundation. It can't be explained by anything else."<br>
        (Erwin Schrödinger, "Mind and Matter," 1958)
    </div>

    <p>Scientist Christoph Koch is working with the Allen Institute and Google Quantum AI to explore the potential role of quantum physics in shaping consciousness. Despite his skepticism, Koch remains open to unexpected discoveries in this field.</p>
    
    <p>These quotes show that there is a growing interest in the scientific community in the idea that consciousness may be a fundamental part of reality, not just a product of biological processes. While these theories are still being debated and researched, they open up new avenues for understanding the relationship between the mind and the universe.</p>

    <h3>The compatibility of quantum physics with the Qur'anic conceptualization of a conscious universe</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>The role of observation in shaping reality:</strong> Just as quantum physics holds that observation shapes reality, the Qur'an holds that man is charged with shaping his destiny and his world.
            <div class="box quran-box">The Qur'an says: "I will make you a successor on earth" [Al-Baqarah: 30].</div>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Reality is not independent of consciousness:</strong> In quantum physics, reality does not exist independently of observation, and this is similar to the Quran's description of the universe as a conscious creature that responds and submits to the will of the Creator.
            <div class="box quran-box">The Qur'an says: "And whatever calamity befalls you is due to the fault of your own hands" [Shura: 30].</div>
        </li>
        <li><strong>The deep interconnectedness of everything:</strong> Quantum entanglement shows that everything is interconnected, and the Qur'an depicts the universe as a homogeneous and harmonious creation.
            <div class="box quran-box">The Qur'an depicts the universe as a homogeneous and harmonious creation." [Al-Zamar: 67]</div>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Multiplicity of possibilities:</strong> Just as quantum physics maintains open possibilities before observation, the Qur'an emphasizes that God acts every day in a new matter.
            <div class="box quran-box">The Qur'an says: "Every day He is in a new affair" [Al-Rahman: 29]</div>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Fifth article: The Unified Cosmic Consciousness Theory</h2>
    <p><strong>When consciousness becomes the fabric of the universe</strong></p>
    <p>After a long journey between biocentrism, holistic consciousness, and integrated information theory, there seems to be a need for a theory that brings all these disparate threads together under one umbrella. Thus, the idea of "Unified Cosmic Consciousness" was born.</p>
    
    <p>Honestly, while writing this part of the chapter, I felt a kind of mental exhaustion - one thought leads to another, more surprising and complex one! But even so, I find myself captivated by the magic of this idea: Consciousness is the fundamental reality of the universe, and matter, energy, time and space are just manifestations of it. It's as if the entire universe, with all its galaxies, stars and universes, is an expression of a universal consciousness.</p>

    <p>I remember having a deep discussion with my daughter one evening: She asked me innocently: "Papa... When they say the universe began with the Big Bang, what exploded?" I stood in front of her simple yet profound question! Really, what was before matter, energy, time and space? Was there consciousness? This kind of question leads you to the realization that existence is not just a random interaction of matter. There is something deeper, something that precedes everything.</p>

    <h3>The main pillars of the Unified Cosmic Consciousness Theory</h3>
    <p>The Unified Cosmic Consciousness theory is a philosophical and scientific framework that proposes that consciousness is not just a product of biological processes in the brain, but a fundamental and interconnected component of the structure of the universe itself. This theory seeks to integrate concepts from quantum physics, neuroscience, and philosophy to explain consciousness as a universal phenomenon.</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Consciousness as a universal property:</strong> The theory posits that consciousness is not limited to living organisms, but is a fundamental property of the universe, present in everything from elementary particles to galaxies. This concept intersects with Panpsychism, which holds that consciousness is inherent in all components of the universe.</li>
        <li><strong>Quantum coherence and consciousness:</strong> Some interpretations in quantum physics suggest that particles can be interconnected in such a way that their state depends on each other, regardless of the distance between them. It is thought that this interconnectedness may have a role in forming a unified cosmic consciousness.</li>
        <li><strong>Consciousness as a unified field:</strong> Some theories propose that there is a unified "field of consciousness" connecting all beings, and that this field can be influenced and react to global events, as proposed in the Global Consciousness Project.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Evidence in Support of the Theory</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Quantum physics experiments:</strong> The Double Slit Experiment and the Delayed Choice Experiment confirm that observation determines the nature of reality.</li>
        <li><strong>Studies of Near Death Experiences (NDEs):</strong> Sam Parnia's research showed that about 40% of people who experienced cardiac arrest reported experiences of consciousness, even though they were in a state of "clinical death". AWARE Study (2014): A study of 2060 cardiac arrests in 15 international hospitals. Of the 140 patients who were able to participate in the interviews, the results showed the following: 46% reported mental reflections or memories associated with the time of cardiac arrest, 9% described near-death experiences (NDEs), 2% reported vivid sensory details (seeing and hearing) related to the recovery room, including descriptions of medical equipment and machine sounds. (Parnia, S., Resuscitation, 2014). Some described minute details of what was happening in the resuscitation room, suggesting that consciousness is not entirely dependent on the physical body.</li>
        <li><strong>Unusual psychological phenomena:</strong> Telepathy, clairvoyance, and mind-matter experiences (such as those of PEAR Project) all suggest that consciousness extends beyond biological boundaries.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Cosmic Consciousness Between Science and Faith</strong></p>
    <p>The Unified Cosmic Consciousness theory opens a surprising bridge between modern science and the profound Qur'anic vision. Both emphasize that: Consciousness is not a superficial phenomenon. Every atom in the universe bears the imprint of consciousness. The universe is a living, connected entity that responds to man and shares his journey.</p>

    <h2>Exhibit VI: The Bridge Between Science and Faith in Understanding the Conscious Universe</h2>
    <p><strong>The Scientific Dream Meets the Qur'anic Vision</strong></p>
    <p>After this long journey through scientific and philosophical theories about the nature of consciousness, an astonishing scene appears before us: Science, which began its modern journey with a strict separation from religion and metaphysics, now seems to be reaching out - sometimes cautiously and hesitantly, sometimes with passionate curiosity - to shake hands with faith!</p>
    <p>What do we see? The major points of convergence between science and faith in understanding the conscious universe:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>The centrality of consciousness:</strong> Modern scientific theories (e.g. biocentrism, universal consciousness, integrated information) see consciousness as the essence of existence and not just a side effect of matter. In the Qur'anic vision, consciousness is present from the moment of creation, and the entire universe is a conscious creature, praising and submitting to God.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Consciousness is not exclusive to humans</strong> or complex organisms, but is present in varying degrees in everything.
            <div class="box quran-box">The Holy Qur'an emphasizes this meaning: "There is nothing but that which praises His praise, but you do not understand their praise" [Al-Israa: 44].</div>
        </li>
        
        <li><strong>The role of observation:</strong> Quantum physics has proven that conscious observation determines how subtle particles behave, and may even change the outcome of events retroactively! This is consistent with the role of the human being in the Qur'anic conceptualization: He is a responsible creature, capable of influencing his destiny and the reality surrounding him.
            <div class="box quran-box">God says: "I will make in the earth a successor" [Al-Baqarah: 30].</div>
        </li>
        
        <li><strong>The deep interconnectedness of everything:</strong> The principle of quantum entanglement proves that cosmic particles are interconnected, no matter how far apart they are. The Qur'an depicts the universe as a harmonious unit, praising God in a harmony known only to Him.
            <div class="box quran-box">The Quran depicts the universe as a harmonious unity, praising God in harmony that only He knows." [Al-Zamar: 67]</div>
        </li>
        
        <li><strong>Multiplicity of Possibilities and Constant Openness:</strong> In the quantum world, reality is full of possibilities before it collapses into a single state. In the Qur'an, we find a conceptualization of continuous renewed creation:
            <div class="box quran-box">"Every day is a matter of affairs" [Al-Rahman: 29].</div>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <div class="box quote-box">
        Testimony of scientists: Between science and faith<br>
        Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, a French philosopher and theologian, provided profound insights into consciousness and its evolution in the universe, especially through his concept of the Omega Point. Here are some of his quotes that reflect these ideas:<br>
        "Stay true to yourself, but always ascend toward greater awareness and greater love! At the top, you will find yourself united with all those who, from every direction, have made the same ascent. For all that rises must converge."
    </div>

    <p>De Chardin's faith shows that the evolution of consciousness leads to a universal unity among human beings, where all meet at the pinnacle of spiritual evolution. "Joy is the unmistakable sign of God's existence," he says. For de Chardin, joy is evidence of God's presence in human life, and is the result of the harmony between spirit and universe. Thus, it seems that the deepest mysteries of the universe are not revealed through cold equations alone, but require a combination of scientific rationality and spiritual insight.</p>

    </div>

    <h2>SEVENTH SECTION: Future Prospects for Research in the Conscious Universe</h2>
    <p><strong>What awaits us?</strong></p>
    <p>All these groundbreaking theories we have reviewed are just the beginning. Humanity today stands on the cusp of a new scientific and intellectual revolution, one that could fundamentally change our understanding of ourselves and the universe in which we live.</p>
    
    <p><strong>What are the most important prospects for scientific and philosophical research?</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Studying consciousness in different systems:</strong> It will extend to: Subatomic particles, plants, animals, artificial intelligence systems and artificial neural networks. What if we find that the atom itself has a primitive form of cognition? Or that some kind of artificial intelligence might one day "wake up" to a consciousness of its own?</li>
        <li><strong>Developing tools to measure consciousness:</strong> There will be an urgent need to develop more accurate and sophisticated tools for measuring consciousness: such as the Phi metric (Φ) in Integrated Information Theory, and the response complexity index (PCI) to stimulate the brain and measure its response. These tools may help us determine the level of consciousness not only in humans, but also in machines!</li>
        <li><strong>Exploring the relationship between consciousness and reality:</strong> Advanced scientific experiments will focus on answering deep questions: Does consciousness create reality? Are there parallel worlds that are created with every decision? Is time an illusion created by our limited consciousness? Quantum experiments such as the delayed choice experiment and the quantum entanglement experiment will continue to play a pivotal role in this trajectory.</li>
        <li><strong>The study of unusual psychological phenomena:</strong> Phenomena such as mental telepathy, clairvoyance, and mental influence on matter are no longer considered "superstitions" as once thought. Rather, they have become respected arenas of research trying to explore the limits of the possibilities of human consciousness.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="box quote-box">
        Philosopher and consciousness scientist David Chalmers wrote:<br>
        "The study of consciousness shows us that the world is fundamentally very strange. I think we have several revolutions ahead of us before we get to its core." (The Conscious Mind, 1996)
    </div>

    <p><strong>Challenges to this journey</strong></p>
    <p>Of course, the road is not entirely paved. There are huge challenges: The need to develop more accurate scientific theories, struggling with a rigid materialism that rejects anything that is not directly measured, and the ethical limits of experiments on living organisms and intelligent systems. But the scientific and intellectual momentum seems unstoppable. Consciousness is at the center of scientific research like never before.</p>

    <h2>Discussion VIII: Philosophical and Spiritual Implications of the Conscious Universe</h2>
    <p><strong>What does this vision mean for us?</strong></p>
    <p>The question of a conscious universe is not just a scientific or philosophical idea to be discussed in the halls of universities; it is a vision that may shake the roots of our perception of existence itself. It is a vision that invites us to rethink ourselves, our relationship with the universe, and our relationship with God.</p>
    
    <p><strong>What are the most important philosophical and spiritual implications of the idea of a conscious universe?</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Rethinking the nature of existence:</strong> If consciousness is the origin, then matter and energy are not the essence of the universe, but merely expressions of a deeper reality. This invites us to realize that the reality we see with our eyes is just a superficial shell... Behind the surface lies a living essence that is full of consciousness and meaning. Existence, then, is not a "blind coincidence," but a journey of realization, knowledge, and connection to a higher cosmic consciousness.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Deepening the sense of belonging to the universe:</strong> We are a living part of a vast network of consciousness, not "tiny entities lost in an indifferent universe," as some materialist philosophers have thought. Rather, we are children of cosmic consciousness, carrying in our hearts a glimmer of its light.
            <div class="box quote-box">Philosopher Alan Watts wrote: "You are not in the universe, you are the universe, an emanating part of it that takes human form for a short time." (The Book: On the Taboo Against Knowing Who You Are, 1966)</div>
        </li>
        
        <li><strong>Fostering a sense of responsibility to the universe:</strong> Caring for the earth is not just an environmental responsibility, but a spiritual one. Dealing with other beings should be done with a kind of respect and appreciation. Everything is alive in some way... Everything is part of the greater cosmic family.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Opening New Horizons for Spiritual Experience:</strong> With the belief in a living conscious universe, spiritual experience - such as prayer, meditation, dhikr - becomes not just a ritual, but a living encounter with the fabric of cosmic consciousness.
            <div class="box quote-box">As Imam al-Ghazali wrote in Ihya' al-Ulum al-Din: "In the heart there is a window that overlooks the realm of the Kingdom, and if the heart is purified and freed from the veil of ignorance, that window is opened and what is not seen by sight is seen."</div>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <div class="box quote-box">
        "Our knowledge of the living universe makes us feel human, and fills us with the ecstasy of intimate friendship, for we cannot be friends with inanimate objects," wrote Noureddine Abu Lahia. "Our knowledge of the worshipping universe teaches us about our function, and makes us sing praise in the circle of remembrance of the vast universe. Our knowledge of the harnessed universe makes us take things from God, not from the hand of nature, and we take things by God, not by our own hands. Our knowledge of the readable universe crosses us from the universe to the constituent, and immerses us in the presence of the Presence, so that we see through things the will of things, and we befriend with the dew drops, the blossoming of the flower, and the blowing of the breeze, the Lord and Creator of the universe and its creator." (God's Universe - The Readable Universe)
    </div>

    <p>In the light of the idea of a conscious universe, man is no longer just a struggle between matter and spirit. Rather, man becomes a living bridge between earth and heaven: A living bridge between earth and heaven. A small ray reflecting a greater light. A conscious creature in a conscious universe. In this way, we rediscover our true role: The role of the guardian of consciousness. The role of witnessing the greatness of the Creator in everything.</p>

    <h2>An Incomplete Conclusion But it is the beginning of a journey!</h2>
    <p>At the end of this long journey between science, philosophy and faith, I find myself unable to put a real conclusion. How can we conclude a search for the secret of consciousness, the secret that pulsates in every atom in this universe?</p>
    
    <p>What I have presented here are only a few modest steps in a journey that may span many years. Steps that I take with you as I contemplate in amazement how modern science - after centuries of adhering to the rigid materialist paradigm - is slowly approaching the ancient Qur'anic vision: A vibrant universe. Everything in it is conscious, praising, and aware in its own way. Man is a living part of this great cosmic tapestry.</p>
    
    <p>After weeks of drowning in theories, articles and studies, I found myself looking at the world around me with a different eye: The tree that seemed to me to be a silent object... now felt like it was speaking to me in its own language. The flowing river... It seemed to whisper its ancient wisdom. Even the stones under my feet felt like they were telling the story of their silent existence.</p>
    
    <p>What if...? What if everything - the stone, the tree, the star - was sharing the experience of consciousness with me in a way I didn't understand? What if the whole universe is singing a hymn that can only be heard by those who listen with their heart, not their ears?</p>
    
    <p>My personal journey with these ideas has taught me a valuable lesson: Epistemological humility. The deeper I go, the more I realize how ignorant I am. The closer I think I am to understanding, the more I realize that I have barely touched the edge of the veil.</p>
    
    <p><strong>The Greatest Secret of Existence</strong></p>
    <p>Perhaps the greatest secrets of this existence are not hidden, but are always right in front of us: In the dewdrop on a leaf. In the gaze of a small child. In the glow of a distant star millions of light years away. We just need to learn to listen with our hearts, not just our minds.</p>
    
    <p>Every atom of this universe speaks silently. If the heart listens to it, it hears its praise and prayers. It testifies to the oneness and beauty of the Creator. and invites creatures to rest in peace.</p>
    
    <p>This is not a conclusion. Rather, it is an open invitation to continue the journey The search for meaning, for self, for God... In a conscious, living universe that speaks a language understood by all those who have dedicated their hearts to the search.</p>
