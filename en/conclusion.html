    <p>... I felt as if something inside me had suddenly opened up.</p>
    <p>It never occurred to me-even in my wildest dreams-that these scattered musings would become a whole book. It was just a thought that came to me and I wondered:</p>
    <p>Is everything in this universe really praising God?</p>
    <p>The verse was like a window that opened in a dark wall, and light poured in that I didn't expect. Paths of knowledge that I didn't know existed, doors of contemplation that I thought the human mind was incapable of breaking through.</p>
    <p>And here I find myself today... I am writing the conclusion of a journey that may be longer than the life of the book itself.</p>

    <h2 id="symphony">A symphony we don't hear</h2>
    <p>Is it an exaggeration to say that the universe is playing a symphony? A symphony so perfect and creative that it almost pierces the heart with its grandeur?</p>
    <p>In the hustle and bustle of our busy lives, we barely hear the faintest whisper of it. It's like standing in the middle of a great music festival and plugging our ears with our fingers, only to hear a faint echo of harmonious melodies.</p>
    <p>That's what I wanted to do in this book, to make you feel and understand it... Removing some of the blinders, opening the closed windows in our souls, making us contemplate - even for a moment - the magnificent scene of the harmony of the universe with all its components.</p>
    
    <div class="box box-quote">
        <p>Consciousness - as it seems to me now, after all this research - is not just an accidental phenomenon created by chance in our brain cells. Consciousness is the very essence of existence.</p>
        <p>Yes! The universe is not a hollow, deaf matter. The universe is a living, conscious, sentient, sensitive, aware entity. It interacts intelligently with its surroundings, testifying every moment to the oneness and greatness of its Creator.</p>
    </div>

    <p>One early morning - with the dew still glistening on the leaves - I stood on my balcony admiring the dewdrops on the petals of a small flower. A strange question occurred to me: Are these crystalline drops conscious? Do they realize the beauty of their composition? Do they feel the sweetness of their existence?</p>
    <p>It may seem like a silly question at first glance, but it became an obsession. It prompted me to dig into modern physics books... What I found there exceeded my expectations!</p>
    <p>Through this book, I wanted to remove the blinders... To open hearts and eyes to a magnificent scene. From the tiny atom to the great galaxy, from the tiny cell to the complex organism, from the roaring seas to the majestic mountains... They are all singing the poem of existence.</p>
    <p>They all beat in a single rhythm. Harmonious. Integrated. The whole of it is directed towards the Creator, the Almighty.</p>

    <h2 id="faith-science">Between faith and science A wondrous convergence</h2>
    <p>It is strange that there is a harmony between what science whispers today and what the Qur'an proclaimed fourteen centuries ago!</p>
    <p>I remember an evening... I was sitting with one of my colleagues under a starry sky. He suddenly said to me: "Do you know that modern physics theories are getting closer and closer to the Qur'anic conceptualization of the universe?"</p>
    <p>I stopped stargazing and looked at him... He was completely serious.</p>
    <p>The shift in the twentieth century was radical in physics. From the mechanical model that prevailed in the age of Newton, to the quantum model that unveiled a universe more complex, mysterious, and fascinating than we ever imagined.</p>
    <p>A universe governed not by rigid determinism, but by multiple possibilities and possibilities.</p>
    <p>In my journey with this book, I found that consciousness is not exclusive to humans. It is pervasive in all atoms of existence.</p>
    <p>It manifests itself in the solid stone that appears to be rigid ... in the plant that grows towards the sun ... in the little ant that knows its way to its colony. In the little ant that knows its way to its colony... In the distant star that sends its radiation across the vastness of space.</p>
    <p>They are all different expressions of a single consciousness that pervades everything. They are all diverse praises to the Great Creator.</p>
    
    <div class="box box-science">
        <p>As we talked about in the chapters of the book, quantum physics has revealed an astonishing world of cosmic entanglement. Particles that remain interconnected and interact, even when separated by millions of light years!</p>
        <p>This suggests that the separation we feel in our physical world is an illusion. The deepest truth of existence is unity and interconnectedness. It is as if the whole universe is one harmonious organism, whose parts are connected to each other in an intricate web of relationships and interactions.</p>
    </div>

    <p>What I wanted to prove through this book is not only the harmony and praise of the universe, but also the deep harmony between faith and science... between revelation and reason between religion and modernity.</p>
    <p>In recent centuries, a misconception has prevailed: That science and religion are contradictory, and that every scientific advance is a victory for materialism at the expense of faith.</p>
    <p>This is completely wrong!</p>
    <p>Real science, as it deepens and expands, shows us more signs of creativity in creation, and more signs of purpose and design in the universe.</p>
    <p>The twentieth century witnessed a radical transformation in physics. From the rigid mechanical model of the Newtonian era, to the mysterious quantum model that has revealed a universe more complex, mysterious and fascinating than we ever imagined.</p>
    <p>A universe governed not by rigid determinism, but by probability and possibility. A universe in which the observer is not separate from the observed phenomenon, but influences it by simply observing it. A universe in which particles are intertwined across time and space, as if they are aware of each other and respond to each other.</p>
    <p>This major shift in the scientific view of the universe has revealed new dimensions in understanding consciousness and its role in existence. Whereas in the classical materialist model, consciousness was merely a secondary phenomenon resulting from chemical reactions in the brain, in the new quantum model it has become more fundamental and essential.</p>
    <p>Some contemporary scientific theories even suggest that consciousness may be the basic fabric of existence, and that matter itself is only a manifestation of this universal consciousness.</p>
    <p>This coincides perfectly with the Qur'anic vision, which tells us that the entire universe is harnessed to God, praising Him and following His will. A vision that places consciousness and will at the center of existence, not at its margins. It sees the universe as a manifestation of the Creator's wisdom and power, not as a deaf machine running according to blind laws.</p>

    <h2 id="pulse">The pulse and song of the universe</h2>
    <p>The universe is, in essence, conscious and aware. It breathes, moves, listens and responds. And perhaps more than we realize.</p>
    <p>Once, on a visit to a nature park, I sat alone under a tall tree. I closed my eyes and tried to listen with my whole being.</p>
    <p>Suddenly, I felt a strange pulse in the air around me. It was as if the tree was breathing, the earth was whispering, and the breeze was telling a story.</p>
    <p>I can't describe it, but it filled me with the certainty that the outwardly silent universe is teeming with life, movement, and consciousness.</p>
    <p>I spoke to my wife one evening about the idea of consciousness in everything, and she smiled a smile... filled with both doubt and wonder at the same time.</p>
    <p>She said: "Do you think that a stone is aware of its existence?"</p>
    <p>I contemplated her question for a moment, then said: "I think it possesses a form of consciousness that we cannot perceive with our limited senses. Isn't the stone composed of atoms? And at the heart of each atom lies a moving world of subatomic particles whose strange behavior quantum physics reveals to us?"</p>
    
    <div class="box box-quote">
        <p>The most profound thing we explored in this book is the living pulse that runs through the veins of the universe, from the smallest atom to the largest galaxy. A pulse that carries within it the secrets of creation, the secrets of the relationship between the Creator and the created, and the secrets of the purpose of existence.</p>
        <p>We discovered that the universe, deep down, is conscious and aware. It listens and responds, interacts and communicates. This cosmic consciousness is not separate from our human consciousness, but is connected to it, embedded in it. It is as if we are drops from the infinite sea of divine consciousness, momentarily separated from it only to return to it in the end.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 id="quran-science">Between the verses of the Qur'an and the theories of science</h2>
    <p>What struck me the most in my research journey was the amazing compatibility between what modern science reveals and what the Qur'an tells us.</p>
    <p>Quantum physics reveals a wondrous world of cosmic entanglement, where particles remain connected and affect each other despite vast distances, as if they were communicating in an invisible language.</p>
    <p>I was talking to a physicist one day about "quantum entanglement," and I asked him: "Isn't it strange that particles separated by worlds and universes can interact?"</p>
    <p>He said something I didn't expect: "What we are discovering today makes me wonder... whether the entire universe is one interconnected body, and that the apparent separation between its components is an illusion?"</p>
    <p>I paused at this answer...</p>
    <p>In this book, we have been able to show the deep and surprising compatibility between the Qur'anic vision of the universe and the findings of modern scientific theories.</p>
    <div class="box box-science">
        <p>Quantum physics has revealed a strange world of cosmic entanglement, where particles communicate with each other across vast distances and are instantly affected by each other beyond the boundaries of time and space, as if they belong to a single integrated entity.</p>
        <p>Recent biological studies have shown that living cells possess a kind of intelligence and cognition. They can sense and interact with their surroundings and make complex decisions that cannot be explained by mere random chemical reactions.</p>
    </div>
    <p>The cells communicate with each other in a complex language, and work in harmony like a musical orchestra, where each player plays his role perfectly, within an integrated tapestry of melodies and harmonies.</p>
    <p>Recent cosmological theories have revealed an amazingly finely balanced universe, as if it were specifically designed to host life and consciousness. If any of the fundamental physical constants were to change even a tiny fraction of a percent, there would be no habitable universe. It is as if the universe already knew it would host consciousness, as if consciousness was part of the "plan" from the beginning.</p>
    <p>All these modern scientific discoveries and theories miraculously intersect with the Quran's vision of the universe, a book that tells us that inanimate objects swim, trees prostrate, mountains bow, the sun, moon, stars and everything in the universe moves according to a tight divine order, and speaks of the oneness and greatness of the Creator.</p>

    <h2 id="research">The Journey of Research and Verification</h2>
    <p>The journey of writing this book was not easy. It took me years of research and exploration.</p>
    <p>I remember long nights spent in front of the computer screen... Scrolling through dozens of websites and research papers... I read what physicists have come up with in their latest theories... I absorb what biologists have discovered in the behavior of cells... And what astronomers have deduced from the properties and laws of the universe.</p>
    <p>I was moving between multiple sources like a bee between flowers, sipping the nectar of knowledge from here and there, and trying hard to weave from these scattered information an integrated fabric, linking the verses of the Qur'an with the data of modern science, honestly, accurately, and without pretense.</p>
    <p>How many times have I tossed my papers aside and said to myself: "This research is bigger than me"!</p>
    <p>But my longing to discover more about this wondrous universe and its praise kept me going.</p>
    <p>I did not want to present the reader with mere self-reflections or personal impressions, but rather an integrated picture, based on solid scientific foundations and drawing on contemporary human knowledge in various fields.</p>
    <p>I have been careful to be accurate in reporting scientific opinions and theories, to be honest in attributing statements to their owners, and to be objective in presenting different points of view.</p>
    <p>I did not seek to adapt science to serve a preconceived idea, but rather followed the scientific method of thinking and investigation, believing that scientific truth, if reached with integrity and impartiality, cannot conflict with the truth of faith, because their source is one and the same.</p>
    <p>I used dozens of specialized scientific sources and references and reviewed hundreds of researches and studies to compile the material for this book. My first concern was to provide accurate and reliable information that stands up to scientific criticism and is consistent with contemporary knowledge.</p>
    <p>At the same time, I made sure to formulate this information in a literary style that addresses the heart as well as the mind, and evokes feelings of amazement and admiration in the face of the greatness of creation and the splendor of divine creativity.</p>
    <p>Real science does not kill poetry and the sense of beauty, but rather deepens and deepens it, and opens wider and wider horizons.</p>

    <h2 id="prospects">Prospects for research and exploration</h2>
    <p>Despite the ideas, theories, and concepts presented in this book, I realize that the journey is just beginning, and that the road is still long and full of discoveries.</p>
    <p>There are questions on my mind: How can human consciousness interact with the larger cosmic consciousness?</p>
    <p>Can humans develop their cognitive abilities to sense and hear the praise of the beings around them? How can science develop its tools and concepts to explore the depths of consciousness and its deepest secrets?</p>
    <p>Many questions remain unanswered: How does human consciousness interact with the larger cosmic consciousness?</p>
    <p>How can humans communicate with the universe and listen to its songs?</p>
    <p>When I was on an airplane one day, as it broke through the cloud layers, I looked out the window at the white sea of clouds and wondered: "Do these clouds have a consciousness of their own? Do they feel the touch of the airplane as it makes its way through?"</p>
    <p>It may sound naïve or poetic, but theories of universal consciousness make it a rigorous scientific question worth exploring.</p>
    <p>How can science develop its tools and concepts to explore the depths and mysteries of consciousness?</p>
    <p>How can humans achieve greater harmony with the universe and its laws, rather than constant conflict with it?</p>
    <p>These and other questions open the door for future generations of researchers, scholars and thinkers to continue the journey of exploration and discovery. It is my hope that this book will be a torch that will light some of the way and inspire them to continue their research and investigation.</p>

    <h2 id="future">A vision of the future</h2>
    <p>I see before me a critical crossroads: Either humanity will continue on the path of separation and alienation, considering itself the master of nature and the owner of the universe, and escalating its senseless war on the environment and the biosphere.</p>
    <p>Or they can choose the path of harmony, realizing that they are part of a larger whole, and that their happiness and survival are inextricably linked to the well-being of the entire universe.</p>
    <p>One evening I stood on the seashore... I contemplated the waves crashing and the stars twinkling in the clear sky... I wondered: "What awaits humanity in the future? How will man's relationship with the conscious universe evolve in the coming decades and centuries?</p>
    <p>In recent years, I have noticed signs of hope in choosing the second path. A cognitive and spiritual awakening in global societies, a growing realization of the importance of environmental conservation and living in harmony with nature. A renewed interest in ancient wisdom and religious texts, which have long emphasized the unity of existence and the interconnectedness of beings.</p>
    <p>The biggest indicator of this awakening is the growing convergence between science and spirituality, between physics and metaphysics. After centuries of separation and hostility, we are witnessing a constructive dialogue between these two fields, and a growing realization that they are two sides of the same coin: The search for the ultimate truth of existence.</p>
    <p>I believe that this convergence will deepen and expand in the future, and will lead to a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of the conscious universe and its relationship with man. In the coming decades, we may witness a new cognitive revolution that radically changes our understanding of consciousness, matter, and life, and opens up new horizons of knowledge and realization.</p>
    <p>At the conclusion of this future vision, what do we foresee? How will man's relationship with the conscious universe evolve in the coming decades and centuries?</p>

    <h2 id="next-steps">Next steps</h2>
    <p>There are several promising areas of research that could develop in the future and contribute to deepening our understanding of cosmic consciousness and its chanting:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Physics of Consciousness:</strong> Developing more accurate and comprehensive scientific theories to understand the relationship between consciousness and matter, and the role that consciousness plays in shaping physical reality.</li>
        <li><strong>Quantum Neuroscience:</strong> Exploring quantum phenomena in the human brain and how they contribute to the formation of consciousness and cognition. Great research... But very complex!</li>
        <li><strong>Cosmic Language:</strong> Deciphering the language in which the universe communicates, and discovering patterns of communication between different levels of existence. Do atoms have a language? Do stars talk? Questions that seem fanciful, but they may be the key to the future.</li>
        <li><strong>Scientific Interpretation of Qur'anic Texts:</strong> Re-reading religious texts in light of the discoveries of quantum physics and consciousness, to extract deeper and more comprehensive meanings. A very fertile field for research!</li>
        <li><strong>Practical Applications of Cosmic Consciousness:</strong> Developing techniques and practices that enable humans to utilize cosmic consciousness in their daily lives and achieve greater harmony with the universe and its laws.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2 id="human">Human and the Conscious Universe</h2>
    <p>At the center of this vision, what is the place of the human being?</p>
    <p>I explain throughout the book that humans occupy a special place in the cosmic consciousness system. Not because he is superior to other creatures, but because he possesses a unique capacity for conscious choice and free will.</p>
    <p>While all creatures praise God by their innate and inspired nature, man alone has the freedom to join or deviate from this cosmic symphony.</p>
    <p>This freedom is the basis of his mandate and test, and is the essence of his God-given caliphate on earth.</p>
    <p>I meditate a lot on the meaning of man being "God's successor on earth"... and I see that this meaning is much deeper than what is commonly believed.</p>
    <p>The caliph is the one who carries the trust of the one who created him, and works according to his will and will. If the whole universe swims in the praise of God, man is required to be the leader of this symphony, aware of its harmony, contributing to its harmony, not destroying its order and disrupting its harmony.</p>
    <p>This freedom is the center of the mandate and test, and the basis of the caliphate that God gave to man on earth. God entrusted man with the earth and made him a caliph in it, and endowed him with the knowledge and ability to enable him to build and reform it.</p>
    <p>But man, in his obliviousness and immersion in materialism, often forgets this trust, and uses his abilities to corrupt instead of reform, and to destroy instead of build.</p>
    <p>Perhaps this obliviousness is the cause of the environmental, social and spiritual crises that the world suffers from today. When man becomes detached from his cosmic consciousness and forgets his belonging to the greater whole, he becomes an alienated, rootless being, living in constant conflict with nature, himself, and others.</p>
    <p>The cure for this alienation lies in restoring man's cosmic consciousness and realizing that he is not separate from the universe, but is part of it, belongs to it, and is in harmony with it.</p>
    <p>This is the essence of the message we have tried to present in this book: To help man regain his belonging to the universe, sense his unity with all creatures, and consciously and willingly join the symphony of cosmic praise.</p>

    <h2 id="return">Returning to God</h2>
    <p>From here the circle of existence is complete, back to the starting point: God Almighty, the One and Only Creator, the source of all consciousness and the beginning of all existence.</p>
    <p>As we started from Him, so we return to Him. As the universe emerged from His will and consciousness, so it will ultimately return to Him.</p>
    <div class="box box-quran">
        This great truth is emphasized by the Holy Qur'an in many verses, including: "He is the First and the Last, the First and the Last, the Outer and the Inner, and He is all-knowing.
    </div>
    <p>Thus, the circle of existence is complete, and returns to the starting point: God the Creator, the One and Only, the source of all consciousness, the source of all existence. As we started from Him, so shall we return to Him. Just as the universe emerged from His will and consciousness, it will ultimately return to Him .</p>
    <p>Perhaps man's greatest goal, and his highest purpose in this life, is to realize this truth with all his being: He is from God, to God, and by God. He should live his whole life in the light of this truth, so that he can be a true slave of God and his true successor on earth.</p>
    <p>I remember a strange situation that happened to me on a cold winter night. I was walking alone in a park near my house... There was silence and stillness.</p>
    <p>I stood staring up at the clear sky, and suddenly, I had a strange sense of mortality. A feeling that I was but a fleeting ripple in the ocean of eternal existence.</p>
    <p>It was confusing and disconcerting at first, then gradually turned into a profound sense of peace and tranquility. It was as if I realized for a moment that I am not separate from this whole, but part of it, and that there is no reason to fear "annihilation", because it is actually "return" and "connection".</p>
    <p>This true servitude is not slavery or enslavement, as some may imagine, but a true liberation from the bondage of passions and desires, and from the prison of ego and self.</p>
    <p>It is the emancipation of the soul from the shackles of matter, and the release of human consciousness to merge with the cosmic consciousness and integrate into the great symphony of existence.</p>
    <p>With this realization, this belonging, and this harmony, man achieves his true happiness and his desired perfection. In this realization, in this belonging, in this harmony, man achieves his true happiness and perfection.</p>

    <h2 id="final">The final conclusion of these hymns</h2>
    <p>Thus, I come to the conclusion of this journey of knowledge... The journey of exploring the hymns and praises of the universe. A journey that began as a flash of thought and ended as a book.</p>
    <p>I do not claim that I have reached the end or realized the end, as the subject is too deep and broad for a book or a mind to grasp. But I have tried to present an integrated vision that combines the originality of revelation with the modernity of science, and links the heritage of the past with the future of knowledge.</p>
    <p>I come to the conclusion of this exciting journey of knowledge, a journey that explores the hymns of the universe and its monads. A journey that began with a simple meditation on a Qur'anic verse and extended to encompass vast horizons of science, knowledge and faith.</p>
    <p>I hope that I have succeeded in transmitting some of the notes of this cosmic music to your heart and mind, dear reader. If this book has any merit, it is that it may make you listen, if only for a moment, to the songs of the universe around you, and realize that you are not a stranger in this existence, but an integral part of it, belonging to it, and it belongs to you.</p>
    <p>If there is one final message I would like to leave with you, dear reader, it is this: Listen to the hymns of the universe around you, listen to the voice of the Creator in the depths of your heart, and consciously and willingly join the symphony of cosmic praise.</p>
    <p>The whole universe is praising its Lord and testifying to His oneness and greatness. Let it be your own note in this great symphony, and let it be your own tasbih in this majestic cosmic procession: tasbih day and night.</p>
    <p>The question I leave for future generations of researchers and thinkers: How can man develop his cognitive and spiritual abilities to become more in tune with the conscious universe and in harmony with the great symphony of existence?</p>
    <p>In the end, I would like to conclude this journey with a word of thanks and gratitude:</p>
    <p>Thanks first and foremost to God, who inspired this idea and helped me turn it into a book. Without His guidance and favor, I would not have been able to accomplish this work.</p>
    <p>Thanks also go to all those who contributed to bringing this book to light, including researchers, scholars and thinkers, whose ideas enlightened me and whose efforts benefited me. And to every friend, teacher and colleague who encouraged and supported me on this journey.</p>
    <p>Thank you, kind reader, for giving me your time and attention and sharing this exciting intellectual journey with me. I hope that you enjoyed it as much as I did, and that you found something in it that enriches your knowledge, deepens your faith, and broadens your horizons of awareness.</p>
    <p>Finally, I hope that this book is a modest contribution to the enrichment of human knowledge and a small step on the vast path of truth. I hope it will inspire other researchers and thinkers to continue to explore this fertile field, dive into the depths of cosmic consciousness, and discover more of its secrets and wonders.</p>
    <p>Until we meet soon, in other knowledge journeys and new intellectual horizons, in which we will explore together more secrets of existence, and contemplate more signs of the Creator in the horizons and in the souls.</p>
    <p>The universe may be greater than our minds can contain, and deeper than our understandings can grasp, but we will still seek to explore its secrets, listen to its hymns, and merge into its eternal symphony.</p>
    <p>How beautiful it is to be part of this great cosmic epic, and how wonderful it is to join the chorus of praise in the eternal procession of existence!</p>
