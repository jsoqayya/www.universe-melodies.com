        <h2>Healing Hymns and Pulses of Praise: The Healing Power of Words in the Light of Cosmic Consciousness</h2>
    </header>

    <div class="box box-quote">
        <strong>Chapter Description:</strong> This chapter provides an in-depth exploration of the relationship between the healing power of words and cosmic consciousness, beginning with the Qur'anic and Prophetic basis for the power of the word and tasbih through the healing verses in the Qur'an and the Prophet's hadiths on Ruqiyah and healing, while reflecting on tasbih as an influential force in the universe that harmonizes with the universal cosmic rhythm. He moves on to scientifically studying healing with the Quran and tasbih, exploring the science of acoustics, the effect of the Quran on cells and sound waves on tissues, analyzing wave theory and how words turn into a direct physical effect on the human body, and delving into Masaru Emoto's experiments on the effect of words on water. It then addresses the Islamic view of spiritual medicine in the light of cosmic consciousness, providing a comprehensive concept of Islamic spiritual medicine, its levels and types, and the cosmic dimension of healing in the Islamic conceptualization as harmony with the cosmic order and the use of cosmic energies in treatment. The chapter explores the relationship between faith and healing in scientific studies, the consciousness of the heart and soul and their harmony with the rhythm of the universe through the heart as a center of consciousness and scientific studies on heart activity and its relationship with electromagnetic fields. He presents case studies and documented testimonies on the effectiveness of healing with the Qur'an and tasbih, through clinical models and medical experiments that confirm the positive impact of spiritual practices on mental and physical health. Finally, he presents practical applications of the power of words and tasbih in contemporary life, from integrative medicine programs inspired by prophetic medicine to relaxation and meditation techniques and technological applications, offering practical solutions to auditory pollution and replacing it with tasbih and the Qur'an as a positive sound alternative. This chapter connects traditional wisdom with modern science, emphasizing that good words and tasbih are not just linguistic expressions but a true healing energy that harmonizes with the fabric of the universe, and calls for the development of integrative therapeutic models that combine the authenticity of Islamic heritage with the modernity of contemporary medicine.

    <h2 id="intro">Introduction: Between the heartbeat of the heart and the hymns of the soul</h2>
    <p>In a time when technology has come to dominate the details of life and the wheels of medical discoveries have accelerated, man still longs for something beyond the body. Something unseen and unmeasured, but felt and touched in the depths of the soul.</p>
    <p>In a time when technology dominates the details of our daily lives and the wheels of medical discoveries are spinning at a dizzying pace, man, deep down, is still searching for something else... Something that is not seen with the eye, not measured with numbers, but it is felt, it is touched, it touches something in the soul that scientific tools do not reach.</p>
    <p>I have always felt that words have a great power. That there is something in the tones of dhikr and praise that no laboratory can measure, no device can analyze.</p>
    <p>From a young age, I listened to my mother recite the Dhikr every morning, with a soft voice and calm features, and I grew up with it as if she was practicing a special ritual of spiritual healing that no one else understood.</p>
    <p>Over time, I became a doctor. I found myself spontaneously, when holding a patient's hand, muttering words of remembrance... Not just out of religious duty, but out of an inner sense that there is a power in those words that makes me, and those in front of me, feel a sense of stillness.</p>
    <p>Over time, I noticed that people who listened to the Quran or practiced dhikr seemed more relaxed, less stressed, and often smiled in the midst of pain.</p>
    <p>This is where my journey began. A journey that was not purely medical, but human in essence, towards a deeper understanding of the impact of the word, especially the mention of God, on healing. I was not satisfied with what I saw with patients, but I went back to the Holy Quran, to the Prophetic Sunnah, and read what was written in some scientific researches on this subject.</p>
    <p>Little by little, a new picture began to form... A picture of a hidden world that is created the moment a verse is recited, a prayer that comes from the heart, or a supplication that is said in a moment of distress.</p>
    <p>In this chapter, I would like to open a window with the reader into this experience, blending the revelations of revelation with the new understanding of the impact of vibrations, frequencies, and sound on the body, water, and even the human psyche that some researchers and scientists have reached.</p>
    <p>But... Many of the studies and opinions that will be mentioned here are still in the stage of hypothesis, personal judgment, and not all of them have been tested according to the strict standards of evidence-based medicine. These experiments do not replace known medical treatment, but they may open another door... one that complements, not contradicts.</p>
    <p>This chapter is not an invitation to abandon medicine or question science, but rather an attempt at a broader vision, a vision that says that healing is not only in drugs, but sometimes it can begin with a word, a prayer, a voice that touches the patient's heart before it reaches his or her body.</p>
    <p>Finally, I would like to state clearly that most of the quotes, experiences, and ideas in this paper reflect the opinions of the authors, and often have not passed through the filters of rigorous scientific research or have not been included in the framework of Evidence-Based Medicine. What we are talking about here is a gray area between spirit and science, which is still under investigation and needs further study and systematic investigation.</p>
    <p>The purpose of this work is not to offer medical alternatives, but to contribute to exploring the possible relationship between faith and healing, between our Islamic spiritual heritage and modern scientific knowledge, and I advise the reader to treat this proposal as an addition to knowledge, not a substitute for treatment, but a human and spiritual extension of it.</p>

    <h2 id="section1">Section I: The Qur'anic and Prophetic Basis for the Power of the Word and Praise</h2>
    
    <h3>First: The Qur'an is healing and mercy</h3>
    <div class="box box-quran">
        The Almighty says: " We send down of the Qur’an that which is a healing and a mercy for the believers, but it only increases the wrongdoers in loss." [Al-Israa': 82]<br><br>
        The Almighty says: O mankind, there has come to you instruction from your Lord and healing for what is in the breasts, and guidance and mercy for the believers.” (Yunus 57)<br><br>
        The Almighty says: " “Say, For those who believe, it is guidance and healing.’” (Fuslat 44).
    </div>

    <p>Imam Ibn al-Qayyim says: "The Qur'an is the complete cure for all heart and physical ailments, worldly and eternal ailments, and not everyone is qualified to be healed by it, and if the ailment is well medicated with it, and put it on his ailment with sincerity, faith, full acceptance, firm belief, and fulfillment of its conditions, the disease will never resist it" (Ibn al-Qayyim, "Zad al-Mu'ad" 4/352).</p>

    <h3>Secondly: Praise as an influential force in the universe</h3>
    <p>I have often pondered this profound verse: "There is nothing that does not praise His praise". I used to feel its impact not only in mental understanding, but in the inner feeling that makes me look at the world around me with a new eye, everything... Every atom, every breeze, every wingbeat in the sky, repeats a praise that we do not hear, but it is present as the pulse of the universe.</p>
    <p>The Holy Qur'an paints a majestic picture of a cosmic state beyond human comprehension; a state of universal harmony where the heavens and the earth and those in them praise God. The Almighty says:</p>
    
    <div class="box box-quran">
        “The seven heavens and the earth and whatever is in them exalt Him. And there is not a thing except that it exalts Allah by His praise, but you do not understand their way of exalting. Indeed, He is ever Forbearing and Forgiving.”' [Al-Israa'a: 44].
    </div>

    <p>This concept is not just a poetic characterization, but an invitation to contemplate the hidden relationship that binds us to existence, a relationship based on harmony and harmony between the human spirit and the great systems of the universe.</p>
    <p>This Quranic concept invites us to contemplate the relationship between man and the universe. This relationship can be understood through two complementary dimensions:</p>

    <h4>The faith and spiritual dimension</h4>
    <p>In the Islamic perspective, tasbih is not seen as an isolated human act, but as a general cosmic state that includes birds, stars, water, wind, and everything we consider "inanimate".</p>
    
    <div class="box box-quran">
        The Almighty says: " Do you not see that to Allah prostrates whoever is in the heavens and whoever is on the earth—and the birds with wings spread [in flight]? Each [of them] has known his [way of] prayer and exalting [Him], and Allah is Knowing of what they do.” [Al-Nur: 41].
    </div>
    
    <p>In his commentary, Imam Ibn Kathir explains this meaning: "Each has learned his prayer and his praise, i.e., Allah has guided him to his way and path in his worship, and inspired him with his own specialized form of praise and obedience." (Tafsir Ibn Kathir)</p>
    <p>Even the birds, as they flap their wings in the sky, practice their prayer and praise, in a harmony that we do not realize with our minds, but we can feel it with our hearts.</p>

    <h4>The Scientific and Physical Dimension</h4>
    <p>When we look at the universe through the lens of science, we find it no less astonishing than the Qur'anic vision. Everything moves in a delicate balance, as if the universe has an invisible rhythm, a symphony that never stops.</p>
    <p>Scientifically, cosmic harmony can be understood in several ways:</p>
    
    <p><strong>Cosmic order and regularity:</strong> The celestial bodies move according to precise physical laws that govern their movement and interactions in a harmonious framework. "The universe follows regular patterns in the distribution of matter and energy on different scales.</p>

    <div class="box box-science">
        <p>Recent astronomical studies confirm that the universe shows amazing regular patterns in the distribution of matter and energy, from the vast cosmic web of strings and voids stretching for billions of light years, to baryonic acoustic oscillations that reflect the "fingerprints" of sound waves in the early universe. These regular patterns, governed by the laws of gravity and thermodynamics, are conclusive evidence that the universe is evolving according to precise and consistent physical laws on all cosmic scales.</p>
        <div class="references">(Springel et al. (2006) - The large-scale structure of the Universe, Nature)</div>
    </div>

    <p><strong>Vibrations and frequencies:</strong> Acoustics research has shown that all materials vibrate at certain frequencies and react to sound waves in specific ways.</p>
    <p>At the heart of physical existence, the science of physics teaches us a well-established fundamental principle, as explained in the book Principles of Physics by Raymond Serway and John Jewett: "For every freely oscillating system, whether simple or complex, there is a natural frequency or set of natural frequencies by which it vibrates when displaced from its equilibrium position and then released."</p>
    <p>This tone at the core of every entity, from the smallest atom to the largest orb, is a unique vibrational fingerprint. When these entities converge, or are exposed to waves with frequencies that harmonize with their natural frequencies, what is known as resonance occurs; an interaction that amplifies the vibration, like a cosmic symphony in which all of existence is in harmony.</p>
    
    <p><strong>The effect of sound vibrations on the human body:</strong> Regular sound frequencies can affect the body's stress and relaxation levels through their effect on the autonomic nervous system.</p>

    <div class="box box-science">
        <p>Recent scientific studies confirm that regular sound frequencies clearly affect the autonomic nervous system, as a controlled study showed that exposure to low-frequency sound (acoustic vibrations) significantly increases the activity of the parasympathetic nervous system - responsible for relaxation - as measured by heart rate variability (HRV) indicators, which leads to a physiological response to relaxation and stress recovery. (Kantor et al. (2022)</p>
        <p>Another study showed that binaural beats at theta frequencies stimulate sympathetic withdrawal and enhance parasympathetic activation, achieving a neural balance that contributes to lowering stress levels and increasing the feeling of relaxation in an objectively measurable way. These findings support the scientific basis for the use of sound frequencies in stress management and vibroacoustic therapy as effective means of stimulating desirable physiological responses in the human body. (McConnell et al. (2014)</p>
    </div>

    <h4>Integrating the two perspectives</h4>
    <p>We may not have realized that our praise, which we often repeat without much thought, is actually a deep connection: "SubhanAllah", he does not utter abstract words, but releases sound frequencies, which have a dual effect:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>From a faith perspective:</strong> Man achieves spiritual harmony with the nature and purpose of the universe, and shares the function of praise and worship with other creatures.</li>
        <li><strong>From a scientific perspective:</strong> the regular sound waves generated by tasbih may contribute to a positive physiological response.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <div class="box box-science">
        <p>In a prospective study in Aceh, Indonesia, involving 114 people (57 in a regular male group and 57 non-participants), it was found that male group participants were 1.86 times more likely to achieve better mental health than non-participants, with statistical significance (p = 0.001)</p>

    <p>It is worth noting that most studies in this area are still in their early stages and need further research to confirm direct causal relationships. Also, care should be taken not to exaggerate the interpretation of religious texts beyond what is indicated by proven scientific findings.</p>
    <p>Understanding tasbih as a phenomenon that combines the spiritual dimension with the physical dimension opens horizons for integrated research that respects both the religious and scientific perspectives, without mixing or exceeding the boundaries of each, while recognizing that there are spaces that science is still exploring in understanding the relationship between man and the universe.</p>
    <p>It is a state of consciousness, a harmony with the subtle rhythms that encompass the entire universe. When we praise, we are - whether we like it or not - resetting the vibrations of our souls to harmonize with the subtle rhythm that runs life around us. We may not hear the tone of the universe, but we recognize its effect and feel it resonating within us whenever we say, "Subhanallah."</p>
    <p>Every atom in the universe is praising its Lord and testifying to His oneness. When a person swims, he or she harmonizes with this cosmic praise, and this harmony creates a balance in the body's energy.</p>

    <h3>Third: Zikr and supplication and their impact in the Sunnah</h3>
    <p>There are many hadiths showing the effect of dhikr and supplication on healing:</p>
    
    <div class="box box-quran">
        <p>Aisha (may Allah be pleased with her) said: “Whenever the Messenger of Allah ﷺ felt ill, he would recite the Mu‘awwidhatayn (Surah al-Falaq and an-Nas) and blow on himself. When his pain increased, I would recite them over him and wipe him with his hand, hoping for its blessing." (Sahih Bukhari 5735)</p>
        <p>Abu Sa'id al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that a man came to the Prophet (peace be upon him) and said, "My brother is complaining about his stomach. He said: "Give him honey." (Sahih Bukhari 5684)</p>
        <p>Narrated Abu Sa‘id alKhudrī:Some companions of the Prophet ﷺ passed by a tribe of Arabs who had refused to host them. Their chief was bitten by a snake (or stung by a scorpion). They asked: “Can any of you treat with ruqyah?”The companions replied: “You refused our hospitality, so we will treat only if you pay us.” They agreed to give them a flock of sheep. One companion then recited the Fāti ḥ ah, collected his saliva, and blew over the bite. The man was healed.They brought the sheep and asked the Prophet ﷺ whether payment was permissible. He smiled and said: “How do you know it is ruqyah? Take it [the sheep], and assign a share for me [when you slaughter it].” (Sahih al-Bukhari 5736)</p>
    </div>

    <p>Imam al-Nawawi says: "This is evidence of the desirability of Qur'anic recitation and remembrance, and the virtue of al-Fatiha and that it has an effect on healing, with Allah's permission" (Al-Nawawi's commentary on Sahih Muslim (14/184).</p>

    <h2 id="section2">Section II: Healing with the Qur'an and praise: How do the cells of the body respond to Qur'anic chants?</h2>
    
    <h3>First: Scientific bases for the effect of sound on the human body</h3>
    <p>In the world of medicine and science, there is no denying that sound has an effect beyond the limits of hearing, reaching deep into the cell and sometimes even deeper. In recent years, scientific studies have begun to diligently listen to frequencies that are not only measured by devices, but also felt in the heart... such as those emanating from the verses of the Holy Quran.</p>
    <p>In an experiment conducted on patients in intensive care units, simply listening to the Qur'an was enough to reduce their physiological stress markers. This relaxation was not transient, but was measurable at a biological level:</p>
    
    <div class="box box-science">
        <p><strong>The effect of listening to Quran recitation on the physiological stress response in ICU patients: A pilot study</strong></p>
        <p>This study shows that listening to the recitation of the Quran can reduce physiological stress markers in patients in intensive care units, supporting the idea that the Quran has a calming effect and is beneficial to mental and physical health. (International Medical Journal Malaysia)</p>
        <p>The study did not show a significant effect on blood pressure, respiratory rate, or oxygenation indices. It recommends that larger and more frequent studies are needed to verify the long-term therapeutic effect and the psycho-spiritual benefit to patients</p>
    </div>

    <div class="box box-science">
        <p>Another study shows that there is a statistically significant positive relationship between the amount of memorization of the Holy Quran and the high level of mental health of the participants. The study recommended that attention be paid to memorizing the Holy Quran in its entirety for male and female students in higher education institutions because of the positive impact of this memorization on many aspects of their lives and their scientific achievement.</p>

    <h3>II: Biological Mechanisms - How sound waves affect cells and tissues</h3>
    <p>When we talk about "sound," we're not just talking about something that can be heard, but actual waves that have shape, amplitude, frequency, and... effect</p>
    
    <div class="box box-science">
        <p>According to a study published in Biophysical Reviews in 2024, sound waves and their vibrations affect cells through what is known as mechanotransduction. These waves don't just pass over the cell, they interact with its deep structure: From ion channels, to membranes, to the cellular fiber network, until they reach the nucleus itself and begin to influence gene expression.</p>
        <p>Importantly, this effect depends on the frequency and amplitude of the wave and how long the cell is exposed to it. This opens the door to a bigger question:</p>
        <p>Could it be that words - especially the words of the Quran - have a special effect because their waves carry a unique order?</p>
        <div class="references">(del Rosario-Gilabert, D., et al. (2024). Advances in mechanotransduction and sonobiology: Effects of audible acoustic waves and low-vibration stimulations on mammalian cells. Biophysical Reviews).</div>
    </div>

    <h3>Third: Wave Theory A journey into the world of words and frequencies</h3>
    <p>When we say "the word is energy , " we are not making a literary statement, we are repeating a scientific fact.</p>
    <p>As a child, I would pass my grandfather's room and see him sitting on his carpet after morning prayers, repeating his dhikr, and his faint voice would sneak up on me and I would feel a strange peacefulness. In those innocent moments, I did not know that this simple phenomenon would become part of an amazing scientific world that I would discover decades later!</p>
    <p>"Words are energy"... is not just a phrase in human development books or in motivational lectures. It is a scientific fact, proven by international laboratories and confirmed by rigorous studies.</p>

    <h4>How do words turn into a physical effect?</h4>
    <p>Imagine with me... When we recite the Qur'an, or pray, we release waves into the air. Waves that have frequency and energy. Waves that come out of our mouths and collide with our cells, tissues and bodies, which are made of water. And that's where the effect - or rather the science - begins!</p>
    <p>You may be wondering like me: Is it possible that the word "Allah", when uttered, changes the tissues of our bodies? Can healing verses literally carry healing?</p>

    <h4>The effect of sound waves on brain waves... Silent dialog!</h4>
    <p>I was struck by a fascinating study published in Neuroscience Letters - a prestigious scientific journal. Weil and Berg's (2007) results showed that regular sound waves - and here's the secret - cause synchronization and harmonization of brain waves!</p>
    <p>Do you know what this means? It means that your brain - yes, that marvelous organ - is listening and responding! And not just any response... It changes its rhythm to synchronize with the incoming sound.</p>
    
    <div class="box box-science">
        <p>I noticed something strange in the results of the study The regular sound waves (such as those found in rhythmic recitations) caused a special synchronization in the brain waves:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Delta: Deep relaxation waves</li>
            <li>Theta: Waves of meditation and creativity</li>
            <li>Gamma: Waves of deep cognitive processing</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Will & Berg (2007) demonstrated that the brain responds to regular sound stimuli through the harmonization of its waves (delta, theta, gamma). Rhythmic recitations are a practical example of this effect: Your brain "hears", observes the frequencies, and then synchronizes with them. Scientifically, this explains the feeling of relaxation, concentration, and even euphoria when listening to rhythmic recitations.</p>
        <div class="references">(Will, U., & Berg, E. (2007). Brain wave synchronization and entrainment to periodic acoustic stimuli. Neuroscience Letters, 424(1), 55-60)</div>
    </div>

    <p>And here I stood stunned... Isn't the Qur'an - in its balanced recitation - one of the most powerful examples of regular sound waves? Isn't it scientifically possible that this divine melody has a direct role in resetting the brain to its normal balanced state?</p>

    <h4>Sound frequencies Keys to mental health?</h4>
    <p>When a friend was sick a few years ago, he suffered from anxiety and tried medications and even some alternative therapies. But he didn't find peace and comfort like the one he felt when he listened to Surat al-Rahman in the voice of Sheikh al-Menshawi. I thought it was just a psychological effect... But the scientific truth is deeper than that!</p>

    <div class="box box-science">
        <p>Zaher and Garanfala's (2025) study in Frontiers in Psychology shed light on the mechanisms of action of Islamic spiritual contemplative practices in improving mental health. They found - surprisingly - that these practices lead to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Reduce anxiety and depressive disorders</li>
            <li>Increase positive energy and reduce stress</li>
            <li>Enhance the ability to cope with crises</li>
            <li>Increased sense of empathy and social connectedness</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="references">(Zahir, F. R., & Qoronfleh, M. W. (2025). Traditional Islamic Spiritual Meditative Practices: Powerful Psychotherapies for Mental Wellbeing. Frontiers in Psychology)</div>
    </div>

    <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Here's the question that I have in mind - and I don't claim to have a definitive answer: What if we measured the frequencies of the Quran, tasbih and dhikr? What if we studied their specific effect on the water inside our bodies? Would we find the key to many of the healing mysteries that have puzzled traditional medicine?</p>
    <p>These findings provide a solid scientific basis for the use of these practices in modern psychotherapy, including in settings such as the treatment of anxiety, depression, poor social adjustment, and addiction. The question I asked myself: Are these benefits only due to the belief and psychological aspect, or is there a real physical mechanism at the cellular and tissue level?</p>

    <h4>Water... That silent responder!</h4>
    <p>Our bodies - that moving miracle - are made up of more than 70% water! But water is not just a liquid... It's a world of subtle responses and amazing interactions. Have you ever wondered... Could it be that the water molecules in our bodies are affected and changed by the sound waves of the Quran? Could it be that the water molecules in our bodies are affected and changed by the sound waves of recitation?</p>

    <div class="box box-science">
        <p>A study conducted using advanced techniques (aquaphotomics and near-infrared spectroscopy) revealed the unexpected! Sounds of certain frequencies (432 Hz and 440 Hz) cause real changes in the structure of water:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Rearrange molecular configurations.</li>
            <li>Increase the stability of water and make it more resistant to external changes.</li>
            <li>Different effects occur depending on frequency - 432 Hz promotes crystalline water formation, while 440 Hz promotes evaporative forms</li>
            <li>Stimulates the hydrogen network between molecules, like building bridges between them!</li>
        </ol>
        <div class="references">(Pilot Aquaphotomic Study of the Effects of Audible Sound on Water Molecular Structure.) (2022).</div>
    </div>

    <h4>Conclusions... And what a lot of them!</h4>
    <p>When I sat down a few days ago to reflect on all these studies and research, I came up with several conclusions that I humbly share with you:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>There is a scientific basis - not just blind faith - for the theory that words (as sound waves) physically affect matter, be it cells or water.</li>
        <li>The mechanism is clear - these waves work through mechanical signal transmission, affecting cells and tissues in tangible, measurable pathways.</li>
        <li>Promising therapeutic possibilities - Imagine a world where we use specific sound frequencies - perhaps inspired by the Quran and tasbih - to treat specific neurological and psychological diseases!</li>
        <li>The road to research is long - we're just getting started We need hundreds of specialized studies to understand the specific impact of Quranic verses, tasbih, and dhikr.</li>
    </ol>

    <p><strong>Personal testimony:</strong> One might say: This is all hard science! And I say: It is a science that breathes faith...</p>
    <p>One night last Ramadan, I was in the mosque behind an imam who was reciting Surat al-Ra'ad in a mesmerizing voice. I was overwhelmed by a strange sensation... I felt like every cell in my body was vibrating and responding. I had been suffering from a chronic headache all that day, but it disappeared completely after the prayer.</p>
    <p>I used to attribute such experiences to self-suggestion or pure spirituality, but today - after all this research - I realize that my body was physically responding to the sound waves, at the level of cells, water, and brain waves.</p>
    <p>Until we reach a deeper understanding, the sound waves emanating from the mouth of a reader reciting the Quran, or a heart praising God in the quiet of the night... One of the secrets of healing that we are beginning to understand scientifically, after having felt it faithfully.</p>
    <p>Anyway... As my grandfather - may God have mercy on him - said, not all truths need proof to be believed, but when proof comes, certainty becomes light upon light.</p>

    <h3>Masaru Emoto's experiments A Journey Between Scientific Skepticism and Faith</h3>
    <p>One chilly morning, I was browsing through summaries of scientific papers when I came across strange images of water crystals forming in different patterns. It was a defining moment in my relationship with both science and faith... What could make water - that simple transparent liquid - respond to words?</p>
    
    <h4>At the heart of the lab... The story of Masaruwa and his controversial crystals</h4>
    <p>Imagine a laboratory bathed in soft white light in Tokyo, where Japanese scientist Masaruwa Emoto (1943-2014) spent years of his life gazing into the silent world of water. This man was not looking for the familiar... Rather, he was - and I can almost hear his breath - searching for the trace of words and feelings in the heart of transparent water!</p>
    <p>Emoto - and I say claimed because I'm trying to remain scientifically neutral - made a startling claim: "Water molecules respond to words, intentions, and feelings." He didn't just talk the talk, he documented his experiments with hundreds of photos in his book Hidden Messages in Water (2004).</p>
    <p>I was browsing through that book for the first time in 2010 at a friend's bookstore, and I remember being mesmerized by the images: The word "thank you" forms beautifully symmetrical hexagonal crystals, while "you're stupid" produces a jumbled shape like a molecular battle! Oh God... Does water really have a soul that hurts and pleases?</p>

    <h4>Science wears critical glasses... and doubts abound!</h4>
    <p>But as a researcher with a passion for truth, I cannot stop at the limits of surprise. Science, that skeptic, stood in front of Emoto's experiments for a long time, shaking its head in bewilderment.</p>
    <p>The first thing that jumped out at me - as I looked at the methodology - were three major scientific issues:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>A methodology full of gaps!</strong> Imagine with me: Very small samples (just a few drops), and a complete lack of "blinding" (that clever scientific trick that prevents the researcher from knowing which sample was exposed to which word). Even stranger - and herein lies the biggest issue - is his reliance on "subjective aesthetic measures," such as: "This crystal is beautiful, that one is deformed"...</li>
        <li><strong>Scientists tried to replicate... And they failed!</strong> That was the fatal blow to Emoto's theory. When independent researchers tried to replicate his experiments with more rigorous scientific methodologies, they found themselves with very different results. Isn't it the essence of science that results should be reproducible by any researcher anywhere?</li>
        <li><strong>The physical explanation... Missing!</strong> As a researcher who loves physics, I have long pondered this point: How can mere sound waves (words) cause a structural change in the molecular structure of water? This contradicts what we know from the basic laws of physics, and is almost like science fiction!</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Serious attempts... and puzzling results!</h4>
    <p>With all this skepticism, it would be unfair to ignore serious scientific attempts to test Emoto's hypothesis. Two studies caught my eye:</p>
    <p>The first, by Radin and colleagues (2006) , showed - and I read it carefully - a small statistical difference in favor of the effect of intention on the shape of water crystals. However, as I flipped through the details of the study, I noticed that the researchers themselves described it as a "preliminary exploratory study"... In the world of science, this is a diplomatic expression that means: "Don't take our results as absolute truth."</p>
    <p>The second study - the triple-blind replication experiment (2008) - was even more interesting. It showed "statistically insignificant positive results (p = 0.03)", meaning there was only a 3% chance that the results were purely coincidental. But - and here's the caveat - there were "uncontrolled degrees of freedom" in the experimental design, or in plain English: the open-ended possibilities in the conduct of the experiment were so wide that the results were open to doubt.</p>

    <h4>But... What if there were simpler explanations?</h4>
    <p>When I was a student at university, my professor taught me a lesson I'll never forget: "When you hear footsteps, look for horses, not unicorns"... In other words, look for the simplest explanation before jumping to the supernatural.</p>
    <p>In the case of the Emoto experiments, there are three logical explanations that don't require rewriting the laws of physics:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Placebo effect:</strong> Sometimes we see what we want to see! Imoto or his assistants may have been influenced by their prior knowledge of which word a water sample was exposed to. This is a well-known psychological phenomenon in the history of science.</li>
        <li><strong>Deliberate selectivity:</strong> Imagine a researcher taking hundreds of pictures of water crystals, and then selecting "only" those that support his hypothesis! Each water sample produces dozens of different crystals, and with a selective selection process, almost any theory can be "proven".</li>
        <li><strong>Publication bias:</strong> Emoto may have shown only the "successful" images and overlooked the hundreds of experiments that did not confirm his predictions. This is a well-known issue in the scientific community, called publication bias.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Faith and Science A never-ending journey</h4>
    <p>As I write this, I find myself in a deep state of reflection. From the perspective of modern science, Emoto's experiments "did not conclusively prove" that water is affected by words and emotions. The available scientific evidence is weak, inconclusive, and suffers from fundamental methodological limitations.</p>
    <p>But... Does this mean that reading the Qur'an or reciting dhikr on water is intangible?</p>
    <p>The Islamic perspective - and I say this with both the certainty of a believer and the caution of a scholar - sees in pure intention, heartfelt orientation, and certainty in supplication a different kind of energy. An energy that is not measured by known physics devices, but is recognized by those who have tasted it and lived its effect.</p>
    <p>Perhaps what goes on inside us when we name God over a glass of water, or when we recite Surat al-Fatiha to a patient, is a complex act, combining a deep psychological effect, a faith dimension, and perhaps mechanisms that science has not yet been able to decipher.</p>
    <p>In the end, I find myself believing in a simple truth: Science does not deny what it does not understand... But it demands rigorous proof. And faith doesn't always wait for experience. But it doesn't mind science when it befriends it.</p>
    <p>In between, we live in a world that is still full of secrets, waiting to be uncovered by both the scientist's eye and the believer's heart.</p>

    <h3>Fifth: Immune and cellular response to the Qur'an and praise The amazing encounter between the soul and the cell</h3>
    <p>It was on a quiet Ramadan night when I sat meditating on a miraculous case I had witnessed myself. An old friend, who suffers from a chronic immune disease, told me how her inflammatory markers dropped significantly during the month of fasting and qiyam. I began to wonder: Could it really be that the words of the Qur'an and the dhikr of tasbih go beyond psychological comfort to directly affect the cells of our bodies?</p>
    <p>That night, I decided to dive into the depths of scientific studies to search for answers that go beyond both blind faith and outright denial... To search for the truth that lies in between.</p>

    <h4>Praise and the cell... An encounter in microcosms</h4>
    <p>With the explosion of biological and medical sciences in the last two decades, the question of the relationship between the soul and the body has become a purely scientific question, not just a philosophical speculation. Now, we can simply ask: Can Qur'anic chants and Zikr prayers really change our immune system? Do the effects of these words go beyond psychological tranquility to reprogram the biochemical balance deep within our bodies?</p>
    <p>As I researched, I was amazed at how the possible mechanisms are intertwined so precisely, like delicate threads woven between the world of words and the world of cells!</p>

    <h4>The Three Pathways How does the word travel from the ear to the immune system?</h4>
    
    <p><strong>1. The Auditory-Neural Pathway The journey of sound to the brain</strong></p>
    <p>As I was reading the research, I was imagining how the journey begins in the ear. When the Qur'an is recited in a reverent voice, or when a believer whispers his praise, the sound waves oscillate and pass through the complex ear canals to the brain. There, deep in the limbic system and below the hypothalamus, other waves of reactions begin.</p>
    
    <div class="box box-science">
        <p>What really struck me - as I reviewed a study published in the International Journal of Biomedical Research - was that listening to the Quran wasn't just a spiritual experience, it had a clear physiological effect: A significant decrease in blood levels of cortisol (the stress hormone)!</p>
        <p>And therein lies the immunological dilemma: Long-term elevated cortisol not only tires our spirits, but also suppresses our immune systems, making us more susceptible to diseases and infections.</p>

    </div>

    <p><strong>2. Sound frequencies and cellular programming... An untold story!</strong></p>
    <p>I was sitting in a quiet café reading a study conducted by researchers at the University of Malaya, imagine with me: they put human cells in a lab and exposed them to the recitation of the Holy Quran!</p>
    <div class="box box-science">
        <p>The result was astonishing... Using a cutting-edge technique called microarray analysis, the researchers discovered real changes in how genes "express" themselves within the cells after listening to the recitation.</p>
        <p>And not just any changes! Rather, an increase in the expression of genes associated with DNA repair and inhibition of inflammation, with a decrease in genes associated with oxidative stress. In simpler words: The cells were responding to the Qur'anic frequencies in a way that enhanced their ability to self-repair and fight damage!</p>

    </div>

    <p><strong>3. The Vagus Nerve... The hidden mediator between praise and immunity</strong></p>
    <p>As I delved into the world of physiology, one of the things that caught my attention was this mysterious nerve called the "vagus nerve," which runs from the brain to the different organs of the body like a thin thread weaving a network of connections.</p>
    <p>During dhikr and tasbih, the believer automatically enters a special breathing pattern: Deep, regular, calm. This breathing pattern - as revealed by a study published in the journal Frontiers psychiatry - activates the vagus nerve, which acts as a key switch in the so-called "inflammatory reflex" within the body.</p>
    
    <div class="box box-science">

        <p>Researchers and organization: S. Breit, A. Kupferberg, G. Rogler, G. Hasler - The paper was published in Frontiers in Psychiatry in 2018 ([bionicsinstitute.org][1]).</p>
        <p><strong>Scientific Abstract:</strong> The paper is a comprehensive literature review that reviews the function of the vagus nerve (enteric abductor nerve) as a neural communication channel between the brain, gastrointestinal tract, and immune system. The study highlights the concept of the "inflammatory reflex," which begins with sensory signals from inflamed tissues leading via the vagus nerve to the brainstem, and then an acetylcholine-dependent reverse message (the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway) to inhibit the production of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-1β.</p>
        <p>The study suggests that stimulating the vagus nerve electrically or through deep breathing techniques, meditation and yoga enhances "vagal tone," thereby reducing inflammation and promoting psychological and immune resilience</p>

            <li>A review of preliminary evidence that VNS stimulation inhibits the production of inflammatory cytokines and shows therapeutic efficacy in conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease and rheumatoid arthritis.</li>
            <li>The relationship between increasing vagal tone and regulating the body's stress response through deep breathing and meditation techniques.</li>
            <li>Demonstration that the cholinergic pathway (CAP) rapidly and effectively inhibits inflammatory cytokines through the α7-nAChR receptor on immune cells.</li>

    <h4>Research... and future prospects</h4>
    <p>As I piece together the threads of this research journey, a picture is forming in front of me: A picture of a possible relationship, supported by preliminary but promising scientific evidence, between the Qur'an and tasbih on the one hand, and immunity and cellular function on the other.</p>
    <p>I've observed real physiological mechanisms: Reduction of stress hormones, modulation of gene expression, stimulation of the vagus nerve... All of which suggest that what we were feeling spiritually may have a deep biological basis.</p>
    <p>But as a researcher who is not afraid of the truth, I admit that understanding this relationship is still in its infancy. Deeper and more comprehensive research, using state-of-the-art molecular analysis tools and controlled experimental designs, is urgently needed to understand how and why certain verses affect certain parts of the brain and body.</p>
    <p>Perhaps - and I call it a scientific prediction - the future holds for us pioneering integrative therapies that do not separate faith and science, and integrate the good word into modern healing protocols, as a bridge between the soul and the cell, between the word and immunity.</p>
    <p>Until that day comes, I find myself reflecting on God's saying: 'And we send down from the Qur'an what is healing and mercy for the believers'... The intended healing may be deeper and more comprehensive than we have imagined.</p>

    <h2 id="section3">Section III: The Eye and Magic as Opposing Forces to Healing Hymns</h2>
    
    <h3>First of all: The eye... When a gaze turns into a harmful frequency</h3>
    <p>I've always been fascinated by a central question that kept popping into my mind as I delved deeper into understanding the healing hymns and positive energy of words... If words can heal, are there words that can hurt? If looks carry positive energy, can they carry destructive energy?</p>
    <p>I remember well an incident that happened last year... I was visiting a friend who had just bought a great new car. We sat talking about it, and while we were talking, I noticed a strange look from one of the attendees full of something I can't describe. That same evening, the car suddenly broke down for mysterious reasons that the specialists couldn't explain! Was it a coincidence? Maybe. But that incident prompted me to research more on the subject of the eye from a scientific perspective, and I found that what happened has amazing scientific explanations.</p>
    
    <div class="box box-quran">
        <p>Ibn Abbas (may Allah be pleased with them both) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: "The eye is true, and if anything preceded fate, the eye would precede it." (Narrated by Muslim).</p>
    </div>

    <p>I pondered this hadith for a long time... "If anything were predestined" - that is, if there were a force in the universe capable of changing what has been predestined, it would be the eye! How great is this expression and how accurately it describes the destructive power of the eye.</p>
    
    <div class="box box-quran">
        <p>Jabir (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: "The eye enters the grave and the camel enters the destiny" (narrated by Abu Naim in Al-Haliyah with a good reference).</p>
    </div>

    <p>Here we find the most miraculous expression... "the camel of the pot" - that is, the eye is capable of killing a huge, powerful camel and making it cook in a pot! This is not just a rhetorical metaphor, but an accurate description of an enormous destructive force.</p>
    <p>After years of research and exposure to recent studies, I began to understand the scientific mechanism behind the eye.</p>
    
    <div class="box box-science">
        <p>A recent qualitative study (2025), published in the academic journal Al-Karim, uses a hermeneutic approach to analyze the concept of the eye in Islamic texts and relate it to contemporary mental health.</p>
        <p>The study found important scientific evidence including the impact of psychological factors on the immune system according to the theory of neuropsychoneuroimmunology, and the nocebo effect where negative beliefs cause real physical symptoms. The study also linked high rates of mental disorders (9.8% according to the World Health Organization) to social pressures associated with envy, confirming the emergence of psychosomatic disorders such as headaches and insomnia as a result of the belief in the eye. The study calls for an integrated treatment approach that combines psychiatry with Islamic spiritual therapy.</p>
        <div class="references">(Nour Fajrani et al. "The Concept of the Eye in the Qur'an and Hadith: Implications for mental health in the contemporary era." Al-Karim International Journal of Quranic and Islamic Studies, Vol. 3, No. 1 (March 2025): 105-118. )</div>
    </div>

    <h4>I. The effect of nocebo is stronger and more persistent than placebo</h4>
    <p>Nocebo is the occurrence of adverse symptoms or worsening of a health condition as a result of negative expectations and its opposite, placebo, which generates positive effects through expectations</p>
    <p>"Nocebo effects are stronger and more persistent than placebo effects" (Rooney et al., 2024, eLife Sciences). The eye acts as a powerful amplifier of the nocebo effect by implanting negative subconscious expectations, activating fear centers in the brain, and creating a state of anticipation of illness and misfortune.</p>
    <p>And here we come to one of the most important recent scientific discoveries... The Nocebo Effect. Studies confirm</p>
    
    <div class="box box-science">
        <p>A recent study from eLife (Kunkel et al., 2025 - preregistered) found that the nocebo effect was stronger and more persistent after a week than placebo, among more than 100 participants tested on experimental pain, using expectancy guidance and internal condition conditioning</p>
    </div>

    <h4>II: Neuropsychological Mechanisms of Nocebo</h4>
    <p>A meta-review indicated that nocebo arises from prior expectations, learning context, and social influences. It has been documented that a person's anxiety and personality traits such as narcissism or neuroticism make them more susceptible to the effects of nocebo. Neural mechanisms include the release of cortisol, activation of the HPA axis and stimulation of CCK receptors in the brain that are associated with increased sensitivity to pain</p>

    <h4>III: Can the eye act as an amplifier of these mechanisms?</h4>
    <p>Not directly - no study has stated that envy alone generates brain waves or hormonal changes in the other party. But it can be argued that:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>An envious glance or an expectation that you are being targeted (even if unknowingly) may affect your internal negative expectation.</li>
        <li>This negative expectation can activate nocebo mechanisms, resulting in psychological or organic symptoms if repeated in a stimulating environment.</li>
        <li>This phenomenon circulates unconsciously through preconceived expectations and activates the fear and anxiety centers, just as other nocebo experiences do.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>II: The Dark Side of Energy: How magic destroys the body and soul</h3>
    <p>Several years ago, I met a patient at a psychiatrist friend's office. She was suffering from strange symptoms that medicine could not explain: Epileptic seizures for no medical reason, terrifying nightmares every night, and sudden memory lapses. "Doctor, I feel like something is living in my head and messing with my thoughts," she said. After months of psychiatric and pharmaceutical treatment without success, the doctor decided to try Quranic therapy and Ruqya. Surprisingly, she was completely cured within a few weeks! This experience opened my eyes to the reality of magic as a scientific phenomenon that can be studied and understood.</p>
    <p>When we read the verse on magic in Surah Al-Baqarah, we find ourselves in front of an advanced scientific document that explains the nature of magic with astonishing accuracy:</p>
    
    <div class="box box-quran">
        " And they followed [instead] what the devils had recited during the reign of Solomon. It was not Solomon who disbelieved, but the devils disbelieved, teaching people magic and that which was revealed to the two angels at Babylon, Harut and Marut. But the two angels do not teach anyone until they say, ‘We are only a trial, so do not disbelieve by practicing magic. And yet they learn from them that by which they cause separation between a man and his wife. But they do not harm anyone through it except by permission of Allah." (Al-Baqarah: 102).
    </div>

    <p>This verse reveals to us the true source of magic: "The demons... teach people magic" - that is, magic is not just optical illusions, but a real science that comes from the demons.</p>
    <p>And the specialized effect: "what they divide between man and wife" a startling indication that witchcraft has a specialized effect in destroying human relationships. And the destructive nature: "They learn what harms them and does not benefit them" emphasizing that magic is a negative and destructive energy by nature.</p>
    
    <div class="box box-quran">
        <p>Abu Huraira (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: "Avoid the seven deadly crimes." They said: "What are they, O Messenger of Allah?" He said: "Shirk in Allah, magic, killing the soul that Allah has forbidden except by right..." (Agreed upon).</p>
    </div>

    <p>Pay attention to this scientifically accurate categorization... The Prophet placed sorcery second only to polytheism! This means that sorcery is categorized as one of the most dangerous and destructive forces in existence.</p>
    <p>Some scientists assert that magic is a form of applied psychology that relies on visual and mental deception and requires the knowledge and training of the magician and the psychological readiness of the bewitched. But it is much more complicated than that... Magic works on multiple levels: Psychologically by planting negative thoughts in the subconscious, destroying self-confidence and psychological security, and disturbing memory and concentration.</p>
    <p>Some sufferers of witchcraft experience vague seizures "up to 10 days or more of unconsciousness, temporary cessation of some senses for no apparent medical reason, ambulatory physical pain that does not respond to conventional treatment, severe sleep disturbances and terrifying nightmares.</p>
    <p>One of the greatest proofs of the reality of magic is the incident of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) bewitching himself. Aisha (may Allah be pleased with her) said, "A man from Banu Zurayq named Lubaid ibn al-Asam bewitched the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) until the Messenger of Allah used to imagine that he was doing something and he did not do it." (Narrated by Bukhari and Muslim).</p>
    <p>This incident reveals amazing scientific facts to us: Proof of the reality of magic - if magic had no real effect, it would not have affected the most honorable and strongest believers.</p>
    <p>Limited impact - the magic did not affect the Prophet's mind or his delivery of the message, but was limited to some personal matters. The possibility of cure - the Prophet was completely healed by the Qur'an and prayer, which confirms that healing has a greater power than harming.</p>

    <h4>Comparisons of Good and Evil</h4>
    <p>One long night of research, I was comparing the effects of healing hymns with those of the eye and magic, when I realized something startling We are facing a real battle between frequencies! A battle between the forces of healing and the forces of harm, between positive and negative energy.</p>
    
    <div class="box box-science">
        <p>Healing chants have miraculous properties: regular and harmonized frequencies (432-528 Hz) that resemble a natural heartbeat, promote the cohesion of molecular water in 70% of the human body, stimulate delta and theta relaxation waves in the brain, and naturally lower stress hormones and cortisol. Healing effects include strengthening the immune system, stimulating disease-resistant cells, producing psychological serenity and spiritual tranquility, and rebalancing the body's vital systems.</p>
    </div>

    <p>I discovered On the flip side, the eye and magic act as destructive forces with completely opposite properties: Turbulent and erratic frequencies that disrupt the body's natural rhythm, destroy the water structures in the body's cells and create molecular chaos, stimulate anxiety waves (high beta) in the brain, and raise stress hormones to devastatingly pathological levels.</p>
    <p>The devastating effects include weakening the immune system, making the body susceptible to disease, producing chronic anxiety and severe depression, and disrupting all vital systems from the nervous system to the digestive system.</p>
    <p>According to the laws of physics, when different waves converge, something called "wave interference" occurs: Constructive interference when healing chants meet the body's natural waves, the healing power is multiplied.</p>
    <p>Destructive interference is when the waves of the eye and magic converge with the body's frequencies, chaos and disease occur.</p>
    <p>I discovered that the human body is like a sophisticated radio station that can be tuned to different frequencies: Positive tuning through healing chants, remembrance and praise, and negative tuning through exposure to the eye, magic and destructive energies.</p>
    <p>In following the cases, I found that the mischievous eye has distinctive characteristics: The source is a single envious soul loaded with intense negative energy, the speed is immediate or very fast (within hours or days), the power can be fatal in moments (as in the hadith of the camel and fate), the scope is a general effect on health, luck and psychological state, and the treatment is relatively easier than magic.</p>
    <p>A doctor told me about a young patient who arrived at the hospital in critical condition right after an envious glance. The man was in perfect health in the morning, and after a meeting with (someone who envied his success), he had a sudden stroke! The doctors couldn't find any medical reasons to explain the condition.</p>
    <p>Magic has a completely different nature: The source is cooperation between the sorcerer and the demons in a complex system, the speed is gradual and continuous (weeks to years), the power is powerful and destructive but relatively slow, the specialty is "separating between man and wife" as mentioned in the Quran, and the treatment requires patience and perseverance in Ruqaiya and therapy. I met a couple who were very happy and harmonious, but after they were exposed to the magic of separation, strange issues began to appear between them. Each of them saw flaws in the other that weren't there, and felt unjustified resentment. It took several months for them to recover.</p>

    <h4>The Prophetic Protection System</h4>
    <p>After a long period of research into the mechanisms of protection against the eye and magic, I realized that the Prophet (PBUH) was not just giving us prayers and dhikr... Rather, he was giving us an integrated scientific system to protect us from negative frequencies!</p>
    <p>"I take refuge in the perfect words of Allah from the evil of what He has created" (three times morning and evening) This dhikr works scientifically as a "frequency protection device" by producing a firewall, boosting psychological confidence which strengthens the psychological immune system against the effect of Nocebo, and resetting brainwaves to normal positive frequencies.</p>
    <p>Surah al-Falaq specifically contains the verse: 'And against the evil of those who weave knots' - a direct and accurate reference to witches who weave knots.</p>
    <p>The scientific mechanism of action includes a countermechanism whereby reciting al-Mu'awatiyin is able to neutralize the effect of magic, purify the energy field around a person from negative influences, and strengthen the psychological barrier against satanic penetrations.</p>
    <p>Before going to sleep, the Ayat al-Kursi acts as an advanced "night protection system", protecting the subconscious during sleep from negative influences, cleansing dreams from nightmares and disturbing visions, and recharging positive energy during resting hours.</p>
    <p>I have come to a firm conviction: Prevention is better than cure. We don't need to wait until we are infected, we can build a protection system that makes us safe from these effects.</p>
    <p>This requires strengthening trust in God with a firm belief that everything is God's permission and destiny, not being overly afraid of the eye and magic, and relying fully on God for protection. Building a fortified personality through high self-confidence and abilities, continuous positive thinking, and avoiding revealing secrets and blessings in front of others. Social intelligence by choosing good companions, staying away from envious people, not provoking jealousy and envy by showing off, and being wary of people with negative energy.</p>
    <p>These are not "psychological delusions" as some claim, but real, measurable and documented illnesses.</p>
    <p>One of the most dangerous effects of magic is the magic of separation, which is explicitly mentioned in the Qur'an. Through the cases I encountered, I noticed that this type of magic works in an amazingly diabolical way by magnifying small flaws where each party sees exaggerated issues in the other, sowing doubts with constant negative thoughts about the other party's intentions, physical aversion by losing the desire for proximity or touch, and turning love into hate in a gradual and incomprehensible way.</p>
    <p>I discovered that treatment for witchcraft cases must be integrated - combining forensic medicine, psychiatry and alternative medicine.</p>
    <p>The eye and magic are not just "popular superstitions" as some claim, but real scientific phenomena confirmed by the Prophet 1400 years ago.</p>
    <p>These phenomena work according to precise physical laws related to waves and psychic energy, there is no supernatural magic in them, and effective treatment needs an integrated approach that combines forensic medicine, psychiatry, and alternative therapy. Smart prevention is a thousand times better than the most difficult treatment, and anyone can protect themselves with dhikr and prophetic prayers.</p>
    <p>Understanding these scientific mechanisms does not diminish faith in the unseen, but rather deepens and strengthens it, and emphasizes the miraculous accuracy of the prophetic directives in protecting against these real dangers. It also clearly highlights the importance of healing hymns, remembrance and praise as powerful and effective scientific and spiritual tools to counteract negative influences and restore the overall health balance of the human being in his body, soul and spirit.</p>

    <h2 id="section4">Section IV: The Islamic View of Spiritual Medicine</h2>
    
    <h3>First: The Concept of Spiritual Medicine in Islam - A View from the Heart</h3>
    <p>When I reflect on our Islamic religion - this God-given treasure - I see that it offers a unique vision of the human being that does not only look at the physical body, but extends deeply and comprehensively to embrace the soul and mind in an integrated and interacting unity.</p>
    <p>How proud I feel as I explore how Islam deals with the concepts of medicine and healing! Spiritual medicine in Islam - and this is my personal conviction - is not an alternative or a competitor to modern medicine, but an authentic, ancient, and complementary part of it, together forming a harmonious system that deals with the human being as an interconnected entity.</p>
    <p>I have often asked myself: How can I define spiritual medicine from our Islamic perspective in precise and comprehensive words?</p>
    <p>I see it as a set of deep practices and principles that stem from the heart of faith, aiming to solidify our connection to God Almighty, purify ourselves from every blemish, and sincerely adhere to the teachings of our tolerant religion, all to achieve a comprehensive balance in our psychological, spiritual, and physical dimensions."</p>
    <p>This definition - as I write it - reminds me of a patient I met years ago, suffering from chronic pain that medications could not alleviate. He started a spiritual program in addition to medical treatment: Reading the Qur'an, praying with reverence, tasbih, forgiveness... After two months, his condition improved significantly. The pain did not disappear completely, but he learned how to live with it, and how to see it as a blessing rather than a curse.</p>

    <h4>The two great sources</h4>
    <p>Islamic spiritual medicine draws its roots from two great sources, which I find to be inexhaustible:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>The Holy Qur'an:</strong> When I read the Almighty's words: "And we will send down from the Qur'an that which is healing and merciful to the believers" [Al-Israa: 82], I feel a real shudder! God Almighty describes His book as healing. During my years of work, I have seen first-hand how Qur'anic verses make a tangible impact. I will never forget a fifty-year-old woman suffering from chronic anxiety, when she started reciting Surah Yus daily, and how her condition gradually improved until she got rid of most of her sedative medications.</li>
        <li><strong>The Sunnah of the Prophet Muhammad:</strong> A treasure trove of practical guidance and applications in the field of healing and therapy. The Prophet (peace be upon him) was not just a teacher, he was a doctor of hearts and souls! I see the Sunnah as an integrated approach to life and a comprehensive healing guide, which only needs to be applied with understanding and certainty.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>The Philosophical Foundations of Spiritual Medicine in Islam - A Solid Building</h4>
    <p>When I delve into the foundations of Islamic spiritual medicine, I feel that I am confronted with a solid, coherent philosophical structure, based on a holistic view of existence. There are five philosophical foundations that I see as forming the depth of our understanding of spiritual healing:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Unity of Being and Creation:</strong> On clear nights, when I look at the stars, I feel that the whole universe is an integrated, harmonious, interconnected unit, created by the great Creator in his great wisdom. We humans are an integral part of this system, affected by it and influenced by it. This unity means that God's laws in the universe - physical and spiritual - are harmonious laws that do not contradict each other. This explains to me why worship has a real effect on the body: Not because they are law-breaking "miracles", but because they are in harmony with the great laws of the universe that God has established!</li>
        <li><strong>The Holistic Perspective of the Human Being - More than a sum of parts:</strong> I spent years studying medicine, learning anatomy and its work... But the human being, as I see it, is not just a collection of organs, but an integrated and interconnected entity of spirit, body and mind, like a golden triangle, where if one side is out of alignment, the whole picture is out of alignment. "A patient who comes to me with stomach pain may discover, after a deep conversation, that the root of his issue is spiritual anxiety from a sin he committed! Another suffers from chronic insomnia, which improves after he mends his relationship with his parents and seeks their approval."</li>
        <li><strong>Balance as the foundation of health - inner harmony:</strong> After long experience, I believe that true health is a state of perfect balance between the components of the human being: Body, soul and mind. Like a delicate balance, when one side is out of balance, the whole person is out of balance. Therefore, I believe that the issue with relying on psychiatric medications alone - as happens in the West - is that they treat the chemical imbalance without touching the spiritual imbalance, and the result is a temporary, shallow treatment.</li>
        <li><strong>Believing in God's ability to heal - the believer's certainty:</strong> And when I am sick, He will heal me" [Al-Shu'araa: 80]... [Al-Shu'araa: 80]. How many times have I repeated this verse on my sickbed! How many times have I felt a sense of peace flowing through my body as I repeated: "O Allah, Lord of the people, remove the affliction, heal thou the healer, there is no healing except thy healing, a healing that leaves no sickness." This certainty that healing is in God's hands alone is what gives me serenity in the most severe moments of illness, and gives me extra strength to resist the disease. Recent studies have proven that this positive mental state boosts the body's immunity in amazing ways!</li>
        <li><strong>The correlation between health and piety - a divine equation:</strong> For years, I have been observing the close relationship between a person's adherence to the teachings of his religion (taqwa) and his mental and physical health. I have noticed how people change when they get closer to their Lord: Serenity in his heart, calmness in his nerves, balance in his hormones, strength in his immunity... Imam Ibn al-Qayyim al-Jawziyyah in his book "Prophetic Medicine", where he says "The heart and soul have a marvelous influence on the health and illness of the body, life and death, pleasure and pain... Joy, happiness and cheerfulness strengthen the nature, help the forces, emit instinctive heat and generate good blood, spirit and soul" (Prophetic Medicine, p. 127). These words, written almost 700 years ago, reflect a deep understanding of the relationship between mental state and physical health, which is confirmed by modern medicine today under the name "Psychosomatic Medicine".</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Types of Spiritual Therapy in Islam - A Diverse Table</h4>
    <p>When I think about the types of spiritual therapy offered by Islam, I find myself in front of a rich and varied table of practices, each of which touches an aspect of the human being:</p>
    
    <p><strong>Qur'anic Therapy (Ruqyah al-Shariah)</strong></p>
    <p>I have always believed that the Qur'an is a healer, not only for spiritual ailments, but also for physical ones.</p>
    <div class="box box-quran">
        Allah Almighty says: "And We send down from the Qur'an that which is healing and merciful to the believers" [Al-Israa: 82].
    </div>
    <p>The word "healing" here is absolute, not restricted to a specific type of disease, suggesting that it covers all types of diseases.</p>

    <p><strong>Healing through prayer and remembrance</strong></p>
    <p>I remember that night when I was suffering from a severe headache associated with a severe cold. I tried taking painkillers, but they didn't help. I found myself - instinctively - repeating: "There is no god but Allah", "Glory be to Allah", "Praise be to Allah", and "O Allah, you are the healer, there is no healing except your healing".</p>
    <p>I still remember the strange peace that washed over me, and how the pain gradually subsided until I was able to sleep! It wasn't an illusion... It was a real experience that I lived many times.</p>
    
    <div class="box box-quran">
        Al-Bukhari narrated from Aisha (may Allah be pleased with her) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) "used to recite al-Mu'awatiyah and breathe on himself when he suffered."
    </div>
    
    <p>This is how our Prophet taught us the way of treatment: Dhikr, supplication, Quran... And then taking physical means.</p>

    <p><strong>Self-improvement therapy - a never-ending inner journey</strong></p>
    <p>It is - by God - the most difficult journey a person goes through: The journey of cleansing the soul from its defilements.</p>
    <p>In my life, I meet people every day who suffer from envy, envy, pride, hypocrisy, and then marvel at the physical pain that shackles them!</p>
    <p>"Before you use medicine, let's search your heart... Is there a grudge you hold? Backbiting you practice? A broken relationship?"</p>
    <p>I remember that young man with chronic digestive disorders, when we discovered together that the root of his issue was a years-long anger towards his father! When he reconciled with his father, his health improved significantly.</p>

    <p><strong>Worship Therapy - A Complete Divine Prescription</strong></p>
    <p>Prayer, Fasting, Zakat, Hajj... The four pillars (after Shahada) are not just obligatory, they are integrated divine prescriptions for the health of both the soul and the body. Each worship works to organize multiple aspects of our lives.</p>
    <p>Prayer, for example, is both a spiritual and physical exercise, forcing a person into specific positions that result in better blood flow, with a mental focus that resembles deep meditation.</p>
    <p>Fasting trains the body's control, rests the digestive system, and activates autophagy, which cleans the cells, as proven by recent studies.</p>

    <h4>The integration of spiritual and physical medicine in Islam</h4>
    <p>The most beautiful thing about our Islamic vision of medicine - and I cherish it very much - is its insistence on integrating the spiritual and the material, not separating them. Our religion sees the two as two sides of the same coin. This is manifested in multiple aspects:</p>
    
    <p><strong>Encouraging medication - taking precautions</strong></p>
    <p>One of the most frequent hadiths I repeat is the saying of the Prophet (peace be upon him):</p>
    <div class="box box-quran">
        “The Arabs asked the Prophet ﷺ, ‘Is it wrong for us not to seek treatment?’ He said: ‘O servants of Allah, seek treatment—for Allah did not create any disease except that He also created its cure, except for old age.’” Sunan Ibn Mājah 3436 (Ṣa ḥ ī ḥ – Darussalam) Narrated Usāmah ibn Sharīk:
    </div>
    <p>This great hadith establishes an important rule: Taking physical means of healing does not contradict tawakkul, but rather it is part of it! How beautiful it is for a Muslim to combine medicine and supplication, medicine and forgiveness, surgery and reading the Qur'an!</p>

    <p><strong>Combining Causes and Tawakkul - a balanced equation</strong></p>
    <p>In the operating room, preparing for a major surgery, I secretly say: "O Allah, there is nothing easy except what you make easy," and then I skillfully concentrate all my scientific abilities. This is the wonderful Islamic equation: Take causes as if they were everything, and rely on God as if they were nothing!</p>

    <p><strong>Integration of spiritual and physical healing - one system</strong></p>
    <p>The story of the patient who regained his health after combining medical and spiritual treatment is not a rare story, but a natural example of our Islamic understanding of healing.</p>
    <p>I like what Ibn al-Qayyim al-Jawziyyah said: "Allah has made every disease a medicine, and He has made the healing associated with the medicine and the causes, so whoever neglects the causes is not tawakkul (reliance), but rather a disruption of the wisdom, and whoever relies on them without the cause is a polytheist" (Zad al-Mu'ad fi Hiday al-Khayr al-Abbad, 4/15).</p>
    <p>This delicate balance - between taking causes and trusting in God - is what distinguishes the Islamic vision from a purely materialistic view that neglects the spiritual dimension, or an extreme spiritual view that ignores material causes.</p>

    <h4>The Conscious Universe in Islamic Spiritual Medicine - Harmony with Existence</h4>
    <p>That night, as I contemplated the dome of the sky, I felt - as I had never felt before - that the whole universe was praising God... Trees, rocks, stars, wind... They were all doing their own praise in their own language.</p>
    <p>This profound insight - which I call the "conscious universe" in our Islamic philosophy - is reflected in the saying: "The seven heavens, the earth, and everything in them praise Him, and there is nothing but praise in His praise, but you do not understand their praise" [Al-Israa: 44].</p>
    <p>It is not just an aesthetic or poetic vision, but has a profound impact on our view of spiritual medicine:</p>
    
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Harmony with the universe:</strong> I always strive to achieve harmony with the cosmic laws established by God Almighty. For example: Sleeping at night and waking up at dawn, eating natural and unprocessed food, living according to the natural rhythm of the seasons... This harmony - nowadays called "circadian rhythm " - leads to better health, deeper psychological comfort, and optimal hormonal balance.</li>
        <li><strong>Utilizing Natural Elements - God's Open Pharmacy:</strong> It amazes me that prophetic medicine focused on utilizing the elements of nature in treatment! Honey, black seed, olive oil, cupping, Zamzam water... They are all natural remedies.</li>
        <li><strong>Harnessing Cosmic Energies - Healing outlets:</strong> I look at cosmic energies such as light, sound and water as God's creations that can be harnessed in treatment, within the legal controls, of course. For example: Exposure to the sun (light) in the morning improves vitamin D production and regulates the circadian clock. Sound (such as the frequencies of the Quran) has a profound effect on brain waves and relaxation. Water (especially Zamzam water) has unique therapeutic properties.</li>

    <h4>Modern Scientific Studies and Islamic Spiritual Medicine - When Science Meets Faith</h4>
    <p>I am heartened by the increasing number of scientific studies that emphasize the importance of the spiritual dimension in health and healing. This convergence of science and faith gives me renewed confidence in our great Islamic heritage:</p>

    <div class="box box-science">
        <p><strong>Studies on the Impact of the Qur'an - A Continuing Miracle</strong></p>
        <p>A comprehensive systematic study was conducted in 2022 to assess the impact of listening to, reciting and memorizing the Holy Quran on the physical and mental health of Muslims.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The study included a review of 20 scientific studies involving 2,566 people. The results showed that listening to the Quran significantly reduces symptoms of depression and anxiety, improves sleep quality and physiological indicators such as heart rate, and lowers levels of the stress hormone cortisol.</li>
            <li>The study showed that memorizing the Quran is positively associated with increased intelligence, and provides protection against chronic diseases such as high blood pressure, diabetes and depression, in addition to increasing the volume of gray matter in the brain.</li>
            <li>Reciting the Quran stimulates alpha waves in the brain and achieves a state of relaxation and stress reduction. The study concluded that interacting with the Quran in its various forms is an effective non-invasive therapeutic tool for improving mental and physical health</li>
        </ul>

    </div>

    <div class="box box-science">
        <p><strong>Studies on the impact of prayer - more than just movements</strong></p>
        <p>What struck me most about Koenig and colleagues' study, published in the International Journal of Psychiatry in Medicine, was its direct link between prayer and lower rates of depression and anxiety. According to this study, prayer is not only a spiritual ritual, but an integrated biological process that affects brain chemistry, hormones, and endocrine functioning! It also supports that prayer is part of a network of integrated psychosocial and physical effects.</p>

    <div class="box box-science">
        <p><strong>Studies on the effect of dhikr - Whispers of Changing Biology</strong></p>
        <p>A traditional literature review was conducted in 2021 to assess the effect of mindfulness relaxation techniques on stress levels in hypertensive patients.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>15 scientific studies were analyzed, including 5 national and 10 international studies. The results showed that all studies confirmed a significant positive effect of mnemonics in reducing patients' stress levels from high to moderate or mild levels, especially in hypertensive patients.</li>
            <li>The study found that dhikr practice is associated with the reduction of stress hormones such as cortisol, adrenaline, and noradrenaline, and leads to a relaxation response of the sympathetic nervous system with increased release of endorphins.</li>
            <li>The results also showed an improvement in physiological indicators by lowering blood pressure, regulating heart rate, and improving neurophysiological status.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The study indicated that the proposed mechanisms include increased oxygenation and mental perfusion due to vasodilation and depth of breathing, which stimulates mitochondrial activity and a sense of mental and physical well-being, as well as psychological reassurance based on tawakkul reduces the release of stress hormones (Septiawan & Idris, 2021).</p>

    <p>On a quiet winter morning, I stood looking at the facade of a modern hospital in my city, with its advanced equipment and amazing technology. I asked myself a question that has been on my mind for years: How could this giant medical edifice open its doors to the soul? How could the Islamic approach to spiritual medicine infiltrate the operating rooms and intensive care beds?</p>
    <p>Today, after a long journey of research and practice, I am convinced that the future of medicine lies in this profound intersection of the spiritual and the technical. Here are some of the applications I have seen or dreamed of.</p>

    <h4>Integrating Spiritual Care in Hospitals - Windows on Heaven</h4>
    
    <p><strong>Al-Islam Specialist Hospital - Kuala Lumpur</strong></p>
    <p>Founded in 1996, it is a pioneering example of a hospital that integrates Islamic spiritual care into an integrated treatment system: A Chaplaincy Spiritual Unit that works within the medical team. It includes Ustaz/Ustazah doctors who visit patients, provide spiritual counseling, and contribute to treatment plans in addition to the medical side</p>
    <p>The hospital is part of the Ibadah Friendly Hospital (IFH) network, which was launched by the Malaysian Ministry of Health in 2006 and later became an official government standard from 2014</p>
    <p>Two years ago, a friend of mine visited this hospital and what caught his attention was not only its state-of-the-art equipment, but the system of spiritual care integrated into the entire health system. It was like a mandatory prescription:</p>
    <p>"Two daily prayers, a morning Quran session, and evening dhikr" - such were the instructions for patients in the ward he visited!</p>
    
    <p>What was described to me during his visit:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A prayer room on each floor, equipped with Qur'ans, rugs, and a place for ablution</li>
        <li>A volunteer reciter who visits patients who are unable to move, reading to them what they request from the Qur'an</li>
        <li>Special headphones distributed to patients who want to listen to quiet Qur'anic recitations</li>
        <li>An illustrated guide to tayammum for patients who find it difficult to perform ablution</li>
        <li>Qibla directions in each room</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Most surprising was the presence of a "spiritual doctor" (a specialized Sharia scholar) within the medical team for some critical cases. He sits with the medical team in their meetings and contributes to the treatment plan with a spiritual aspect that is integrated with the medical aspect.</p>
    <p>He was moved by the experience, and I started thinking: What if we applied this model in our hospitals? What if we added an authentic Islamic spiritual dimension to our modern medical system?</p>

    <p><strong>Developing Integrative Treatment Programs - Prescriptions from Heaven</strong></p>
    <p>The IICBT Model - University of Malaya (Therapist's Guide, 2018)</p>
    <p>"The IICBT (Islamic Integrated CBT) protocol was developed at the University of Malaya - Malaysia as a recognized 10-session structured therapy that consciously combines CBT with the Islamic spirit (Quran, Dhikr, Tawhid, Gratitude, Giving). It aims to enhance the patient's cognitive and emotional control, transforming thinking into religious resources that promote recovery."</p>
    
    <p>Objectives of the sessions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Building a trusting relationship with the patient, assessing their condition, introducing them to the concept of ICBT and behavioral activation through the integration of faith (Walking by Faith).</li>
        <li>Monitoring negative thoughts (The Battlefield of the Mind).</li>
        <li>Challenging and resisting negative thoughts (Bringing All Thoughts Captive).</li>
        <li>Dealing with loss or disappointment. Confronting spiritual conflicts and negative emotions and Altruism & Generosity to build social hope.</li>
        <li>Gaining personal and psychological growth from challenges, promoting hope, and Relapse Prevention</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="references">(The program was developed by the University of Malaya School of Medicine team (Dr. Zuraida Ahmad Subki et al., 2018), under the academic and spiritual guidance of Harold J. Koenig. Koenig, and is used to treat depression in patients)</div>

    <h4>Challenges and controls</h4>
    <p>Despite the great importance of spiritual medicine in Islam, its application faces some challenges and requires adherence to very important controls, which I always emphasize as vital:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Fighting superstition and quackery:</strong> I categorically reject all forms of sorcery and quackery practiced in the name of spiritual medicine. Our religion is innocent of such practices.</li>
        <li><strong>Adherence to Shari'ah regulations:</strong> All therapeutic practices must be fully compliant with Sharia law. This is a red line.</li>
        <li><strong>Integration with modern medicine:</strong> Spiritual medicine does not supersede modern medicine in any way, it complements and enhances it, and both are necessary.</li>
        <li><strong>Avoid exaggeration:</strong> Avoid exaggerating the therapeutic claims of spiritual practices, and stick to what is mentioned in the Sharia texts only, not over-promising.</li>
        <li><strong>Confusing the Islamic concept with imported concepts:</strong> There is a risk of confusing the Islamic concept of cosmic energy with Eastern concepts such as "cosmic energy" in Hindu and Buddhist philosophies.</li>
        <li><strong>Lack of scientific studies:</strong> There are limited scientific studies that study spiritual medicine from an Islamic perspective.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Spiritual medicine in Islam is based on the principles of "prevention and treatment"</p>
    <p>Prevention is through the promotion of true faith, self-cultivation, and adherence to legal commands and prohibitions. Treatment, on the other hand, is through Ruqyah, supplication, forgiveness, reading the Quran, and praise, all practices that promote spiritual, physical, and psychological health at the same time.</p>
    <p>As my sheikh once told me: "True medicine is that which addresses the human body to heal it, the human mind to understand it, and the human soul to heal it.</p>

    <h3>II: The Cosmic Dimension of Healing in the Islamic Conceptualization</h3>
    <p>Healing is more than just medicine - a journey into the depths of the Islamic concept</p>
    <p>I am always amazed by the comprehensive Islamic vision of the healing process that goes far beyond the limits of the physical human body. From our perspective, healing is not just an elaborate biological process to fix a physical defect, but an integrated journey that connects the human being to the surrounding universe and to the Great Creator.</p>
    <p>This unique therapeutic journey utilizes cosmic forces - such as praise, remembrance, and recitation of the Quran - to restore lost balance, whether physical, psychological, or spiritual. It is a therapeutic philosophy that views the human being as part of a larger cosmic system, not as an isolated entity to be treated in isolation from its surroundings.</p>
    <p>It is a journey that utilizes the power of the rosary to restore lost balance, be it physical, psychological or spiritual.</p>
    <p>I will try to explore this angle of the healing process by drawing on legal and Islamic texts with a rich heritage, as well as some modern scientific studies that begin to explore the intimate relationship between man and the universe.</p>

    <h4>The concept of healing in Islamic conceptualization - deeper than the absence of disease</h4>
    <p>In language, healing is simply defined as being free from disease. But in Islamic terminology, the concept expands to encompass deeper and more comprehensive dimensions.</p>
    <p>Ibn al-Qayyim says in his book "Zad al-Mu'ad" in words that summarize this holistic view: "Healing is innocence from sickness and disease, whether it is in bodies, hearts or souls" (Zad al-Mu'ad, 4/178).</p>
    <p>This deep concept of healing in Islam is characterized by basic characteristics that we will review:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Comprehensiveness - treating the human being as an integrated unit:</strong> Islamic healing is not limited to treating a specific organ or disorder, but rather encompasses all aspects of the human being: physical, psychological and spiritual. It is an approach that deals with the human being as an integrated whole, not as a collection of separate parts. Modern medicine often fails to treat some cases because it treats the diseased organ without considering the psychological or spiritual state of the patient, while the Islamic approach sees that the disease may start in the soul, then reflect on the soul, and finally on the body, or vice versa.</li>
        <li><strong>Its monotheistic dimension - the healer is God:</strong> Every time I feel healed from an illness, I realize that as a Muslim, I realize that Allah alone is the source of my strength and healing. I always remember God's words on the lips of Prophet Ibrahim, peace be upon him: "When I am sick, He heals me" [Al-Shu'araa: 80]. This monotheistic dimension gives the patient deep tranquility and frees him from the anxiety of absolute dependence on material causes alone, as medicines and doctors are only causes, and the real healer is God.</li>
        <li><strong>The various means of healing - complementarity, not contradiction:</strong> The beauty of the Islamic concept of healing is that it combines physical means (such as medicines and treatments) with spiritual means (such as the Qur'an and prayer). There is no conflict between them, but rather complementarity and harmony. The Prophet Muhammad, who called us to take medicines and reasons, is the same one who taught us Ruqyah and supplication. It is a balanced vision that blends science and faith in a wonderful harmony.</li>
        <li><strong>Its cosmic dimension - man is part of a larger system:</strong> This is the focus of our conversation! The Islamic concept of healing recognizes that man is not an isolated entity, but is part of a harmonious cosmic system, created and governed by God Almighty. In this concept, human healing is related to the extent to which a person is in harmony with the cosmic order established by God, and the extent to which he is in harmony with the physical and spiritual laws of the universe.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>The Cosmic Dimension of Healing - Four Integrated Axes</h4>
    <p>Based on this Qur'anic concept of the praising universe, we can explore the cosmic dimension of healing in the Islamic conceptualization through four main axes:</p>
    
    <p><strong>1. Harmony with the cosmic order - restoring the lost balance</strong></p>
    <p>In the Islamic conceptualization, illness is seen - in part - as the result of a departure from the cosmic order established by God Almighty. This departure may be on the physical level (such as violating the laws of health and nutrition) or on the spiritual level (such as turning away from the remembrance and worship of God).</p>
    <p>Healing, in this sense, is achieved by returning to harmony with the cosmic order designed by the Creator. Ibn al-Qayyim summarizes this idea: "Disease is a kind of departure from natural moderation, and health is a kind of return to it" (Prophetic Medicine, p. 33).</p>
    <p>Elsewhere he emphasizes: "The way to preserve health is to use things in a way that is in accordance with the requirements of the total and individual nature" (Zad al-Ma'ad, 4/196).</p>
    <p>When man sleeps at night and wakes up at dawn, when he eats good things and avoids bad things, when he balances his emotions and controls his anger, he is in harmony with the cosmic order set by God, and this harmony is the basis of health and healing.</p>

    <p><strong>2. The Qur'an is a cosmic revelation - the words of the Creator to His creatures</strong></p>
    <div class="box box-quran">
        <p>God Almighty has described the Qur'an as healing in multiple verses:</p>
        <p>"And We send down from the Qur'an what is healing and mercy for the believers" [Al-Israa: 82].</p>
        <p>"Say: 'For those who believe, it is guidance and healing'" [Faslat: 44].</p>
        <p>O mankind, there has come to you a warning from your Lord and a cure for what is in your hearts [Yunus: 57].</p>
    </div>

    <p><strong>3. Tasbih as a means of cosmic harmony - joining the symphony of existence</strong></p>
    <p>Tasbih and dhikr are among the most important means of healing in the Islamic conceptualization. Their cosmic dimension can be understood by:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>a. Joining the cosmic tasbih:</strong> When a Muslim praises, he joins the cosmic "chorus" of praise that includes all of God's creatures, as Almighty God says: "There is nothing but praise in His praise" [Al-Isra: 44]. This harmony with the cosmic tasbih helps to restore the inner balance of the human being, as if the praiser resets his rhythm to the original rhythm of the universe, after his obliviousness took him away from it.</li>
        <li><strong>b. Achieving tranquility:</strong> The Holy Qur'an links the remembrance of God with achieving tranquility: "In the remembrance of Allah, hearts are tranquilized" [Al-Ra'd: 28]. This tranquility is not just a transient psychological state, but a real physiological state that is reflected in a person's mental and physical health.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>4. Healing through cosmic energies - utilizing the resources of the universe</strong></p>
    <p>The Islamic concept deals with the concept of cosmic energy with caution and balance, recognizing the existence of energies in the universe that can be utilized for healing, but within the legal controls:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>A. Utilizing natural elements:</strong> Islam urges the utilization of natural elements in treatment:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Water:</strong> Allah says: "And We sent down from the sky pure water" [Al-Furqan: 48]. The Prophet (peace be upon him) used water to treat fever and others.</li>
                <li><strong>Honey:</strong> The Almighty said: "There is healing in it for people" [al-Nahl: 69]. Modern science has proven the immense therapeutic value of honey.</li>
                <li><strong>The sun and the moon:</strong> Allah says: "And He made the moon in them a light and made the sun a lamp" [Noah: 16]. Science has proven the importance of the sun in the formation of vitamin D and the regulation of the circadian clock.</li>
                <li><strong>Air and soil:</strong> The Sunnah emphasized the importance of fresh air and contact with dust in strengthening immunity.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>B. Invisible Energies:</strong> Islam recognizes the existence of invisible energies in the universe, but it sets strict controls to deal with them:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Magic and sorcery:</strong> Islam forbids the use of jinns and magic for treatment: "Solomon did not disbelieve, but the demons disbelieved, teaching people magic" [Al-Baqarah: 102].</li>
                <li><strong>Legal ruqyah:</strong> On the other hand, Islam legalizes the use of the Qur'an and traditional prayers, which is an investment of spiritual energies in healing.</li>
                <li><strong>Healing through prayer:</strong> Islam considers supplication to be an effective means of healing, as the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: "Prayer is the weapon of the believer" (narrated by Al-Hakim).</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="section5">Section V: Heart and soul awareness and harmony with the rhythm of the universe</h2>
    <p>That night was different from the others. I sat contemplating in front of my window, open to a starry sky, remembering my grandmother - God rest her soul - when she used to say with every medicine she took, "O Healer, O Healer, there is no healing except your healing. "O Healer, O Healer, there is no healing except your healing." I was a child then, and now that I am a doctor, I realize the depth of those words, which combined taking the causes (medicine) with the certainty of the cause (God). She was practicing - unknowingly - the essence of what we call today "Islamic spiritual medicine".</p>

    <h3>First: The heart as the center of consciousness in the Islamic conceptualization</h3>
    <p>The heart occupies a central place in the Islamic conceptualization of consciousness, as the Qur'an and Sunnah refer to the role of the heart as a cognitive organ and not just a physiological organ:</p>
    
    <div class="box box-quran">
        <p>The Qur'an and the Sunnah refer to the role of the heart as a cognitive apparatus, not just a physiological organ (Al-Hajj: 46).</p>
        <p>In the authentic hadith: "There is in the body a corpuscle, if it is healthy, the whole body is healthy, and if it is corrupted, the whole body is corrupted, namely the heart" (Agreed upon: Bukhari 52, Muslim 1599).</p>
    </div>

    <p>Imam al-Ghazali explains the concept of the heart in the Islamic tradition in "Explaining the Wonders of the Heart" in "Ihya' al-'Ulum al-Din" that the heart is used in two senses: One is that organic piece of pine cone, and the other is the spiritual divine quality associated with it, which is the reality of the perceiving human being and the knowing scientist, and its association with him is similar to the association of symptoms with bodies. The term 'heart' in the book refers to this sweetness as the place of perception and knowledge." (Al-Ghazali, "Revival of the Sciences of Religion", 3/3).</p>
    <p>Ibn Taymiyyah emphasized the importance of the heart as the center of understanding and perception: "The heart is the heart of the chest, the place of faith, piety, knowledge, will, intention and determination" (Ibn Taymiyyah, "Total Fatwas", 10/137).</p>

    <h3>Second: Scientific studies on heart activity and its relationship to electromagnetic fields</h3>
    <p>Some recent scientific studies suggest that the heart produces a measurable electromagnetic field</p>
    
    <div class="box box-science">
        <p><strong>The electromagnetic field of the heart</strong></p>
        <p>HeartMath Institute studies have shown that the heart produces a stronger electromagnetic field than the one produced by the brain. Researcher Rollin McCraty and colleagues explain: "The heart's electromagnetic field can be measured several feet away from the body using SQUID (superconducting quantum interference device) devices."</p>
        <div class="references">(McCraty et al., "The Coherent Heart: Heart-Brain Interactions, Psychophysiological Coherence, and the Emergence of System-Wide Order", HeartMath Research Center, 2009).</div>
    </div>

    <div class="box box-science">
        <p><strong>The effect of psychological state on heart activity</strong></p>
        <p>A study by Timothy et al. showed that "different psychological states such as deep relaxation, meditation, or states of reverence are associated with certain ECG patterns that show greater consistency compared to states of stress or anxiety"</p>
        <div class="references">(Timothy et al., "Effects of Positive Emotional States on Heart Rate Variability" Psychophysiology, 2016, 53(11), 1618-1625)</div>
    </div>

    <div class="box box-science">
        <p><strong>The relationship between heart rhythms and geomagnetic fields</strong></p>
        <p>A study published in the journal Scientific Reports found a relationship between heart activity and changes in the Earth's magnetic field: "Heart rate variability in humans shows sensitivity to changes in geomagnetic activity, with differences in effect by sex and age."</p>
        <div class="references">((Alabdulgader et al., "Human heart rhythm sensitivity to earth local magnetic field fluctuations", Scientific Reports, 2018, 8, 13351).</div>
    </div>

    <h3>Third: The effect of spiritual practices on heart function</h3>
    
    <div class="box box-science">
        <p><strong>Recitation of the Qur'an</strong></p>
        <p>"Mirbagher et al. Quran recitation had a significant effect on lowering anxiety, pulse rate, and blood pressure in patients before catheterization or CABG procedures, and these effects were greater than the effect of music (Mirbagher-Ajorpaz N, Aghajani M, Shahshahani M (2011).</p>
        <div class="references">(Mirbagher-Ajorpaz N, Aghajani M, Shahshahani M (2011): The effects of music and Holy Qur'an on patients' anxiety and vital signs before abdominal surgery, Journal of Mashhad University of Medical Sciences).</div>
    </div>

    <h3>Fourth: The heart's function beyond the physiological aspect</h3>
    
    <h4>1. the heart as a center of consciousness: The Second Brain and the Cardiac Neural Network</h4>
    <p>In the context of our understanding of the consciousness of the heart and soul and their harmony with the rhythm of the universe, the discovery of the neural network in the heart represents a scientific turning point that sheds light on what religious texts and traditions have been pointing out for centuries.</p>
    
    <p><strong>The Scientific Discovery of the Heart Brain</strong></p>
    <p>Recent scientific research has revealed the existence of an integrated nervous system within the heart, operating independently of the main brain.</p>
    <p>In 1991, Dr. Andrew Armour made a startling discovery when he observed about 40,000 neurons (sensory neurons) forming what became known scientifically as the "heart brain" or the "heart's little brain" (Armour, 1991).</p>
    <p>This complex neural network has properties similar to neurons in the brain, producing neurotransmitters and functional proteins, and possessing the ability to learn, remember, and feel independently.</p>
    <p>What makes this discovery even more significant is that the heart produces an electromagnetic field that is about 60 times stronger than that of the brain and can be measured several feet away from the body using sensitive devices.</p>
    <p>According to HeartMath Institute research, "this field carries information that reflects a person's emotional and physiological state, and can influence those around them" (HeartMath Institute, n.d.).</p>
    <p>These discoveries offer a new understanding of the relationship between the heart and the brain. The heart not only receives commands from the brain, but also sends signals to the brain that affect cognition, emotions, and decision-making. Dr. Thomas Verny points out that "the heart sends more signals to the brain than it receives from it, and these signals affect the centers of memory, cognition, and emotion" (Verny, 2022).</p>
    <p>The principle that the heart sends more signals to the brain than it receives from it, and that these signals affect higher brain functions (including memory, cognition, and emotion), is a fundamental concept in the field of neurocardiology . This discovery is not entirely new, and has been reinforced and elaborated by extensive research over the past decades, especially by research institutes such as the HeartMath Institute</p>
    <p>Dr. Thomas Verny: An author in the field of peripheral psychology and consciousness, his recent work has addressed the concept of the heart as a cognitive center and influencer of the brain. His latest book, The Embodied Mind : Understanding the Mysteries of Cellular Memory, Consciousness, and Our Bodies , published in 2022, elaborates on these ideas, emphasizing that the mind is not limited to the brain but is distributed throughout the body, and that the heart plays a pivotal role in this complex network of communication.</p>

    <p><strong>Integrating science and the Islamic conceptualization of the heart</strong></p>
    <p>This scientific discovery offers a new perspective on the traditional Islamic understanding of the heart as the center of consciousness and cognition. The Qur'an refers in several places to the heart's cognitive and perceptive function: "Have they not walked the earth and had hearts with which to reason ?" (Al-Hajj: 46).</p>
    <p>In Islamic jurisprudence, scholars such as Imam al-Ghazali elaborated on the functions of the heart beyond the organic: "The heart has two meanings: One is this pineal organ... The second is a spiritual, divine organ... This is the truth of man, and he is the perceiver, the knowing scientist of man" (Al-Ghazali, 3/3).</p>
    
    <p><strong>An Integrated Understanding of Heart Consciousness</strong></p>
    <p>The discovery of the cardiac neural network makes an important contribution to building a bridge between modern science and traditional spiritual concepts of heart consciousness. This integration is not just a superficial compatibility, but a deeper vision of the human being as an integrated being, in which the physical and spiritual dimensions interact in a harmonious unity.</p>
    <p>This discovery also reminds us of the need to adopt a holistic approach to understanding the human being and health, beyond the reductionist view of the body, and to understand the role of the heart as a center of consciousness, wisdom and perception, which is consistent with the Almighty's words: "There is in this a remembrance for those who have a heart or listen to the hearing while they are witnesses" (Q: 37).</p>
    <p>We are still at the beginning of exploring the secrets of the heart and its relationship with consciousness and cognition, and there remains an urgent need for more multidisciplinary studies that explore the relationship between heart physiology and spiritual and cognitive experiences, within a framework that respects the Islamic heritage and benefits from scientific progress at the same time.</p>

    <h4>2.The role of the heart in emotional cognition</h4>
    <p>The heart responds to emotional stimuli before the brain, reinforcing the idea that the heart is involved in the process of sensing and initial perception of emotional information before it is processed in the brain</p>

    <h3>Fifth: Scientific interpretation of the concept of the heart in harmony with the universe</h3>
    
    <p><strong>Contemporary theories</strong></p>
    <div class="box box-science">
        <p>Dr. Rollin McCraty of the HeartMath Institute proposes a theoretical model that states: "When the heart rate is in harmony, the heart's electromagnetic field may interact with surrounding environmental fields, including the Earth's geomagnetic field, which may facilitate some sort of communication or information exchange" (McCraty, "Science of the Heart, Volume 2", HeartMath Research Center, 2015).</p>
        <p>As in the previous study, the heart has what is considered the strongest electromagnetic field in the body, much stronger than the brain's electrical activity, and can be measured several feet away using SQUID devices.</p>
        <p>When the heartbeat pattern is ordered and aligned (i.e. a state of coherence), this emitted field is more organized and regular; HeartMath demonstrates that this organization can form the basis for an "energetic" connection between individuals and the surrounding environment, perhaps even with the Earth's geomagnetic field in the context of what they call Global Coherence</p>
        <p>This has the potential for the heart to become a radio-like information field that can be "felt" by others within its range, and in some cases, a kind of "heart-rhythm synchronization" can occur between people who are physically distant in an emotionally cohesive or training group.</p>
    </div>

    <p><strong>Integration of Science and Faith</strong></p>
    <p>The Islamic view of the heart offers an understanding that goes beyond its organic function as a blood pump; it is, in essence, a profound center of consciousness, cognition, and emotions.</p>
    <p>Scholars who specialize in linking religious texts with scientific facts, such as Dr. Muhammad Ali al-Bar, emphasize in his writings that this Islamic view of the heart never conflicts with modern scientific discoveries, but rather complements them in a comprehensive framework.</p>
    <p>While science highlights the physiological and neurological mechanisms of the heart that may explain part of its role in cognition, Islamic teachings highlight the deep spiritual dimensions of the heart as a center of faith and insight.</p>
    <p>In this way, science reveals mechanisms that explain some of the revelations, without denying the high spiritual dimensions that remain part of the unseen, which cannot be realized by material science alone.</p>

    <h2 id="section6">Section VI: Case Studies and Testimonies on the Effectiveness of Healing with the Qur'an and Tasbih</h2>
    
    <h3>Examples of Qur'anic healing</h3>
    <p>The phenomenon of healing by the Holy Qur'an represents a meeting point between faith and science, between spirituality and medicine, a phenomenon rooted in Islamic history and based on established legal principles. God Almighty says: "And we will descend from the Qur'an what is healing and mercy for the believers" [Al-Israa: 82].</p>
    <p>In this article, we review documented examples of cases of healing with the Quran and tasbih, while adhering to the scientific methodology in presenting and analyzing the cases, and referring to medical studies that addressed this phenomenon, while avoiding exaggerations and unsubstantiated claims.</p>
    
    <h4>Documented examples of healing with the Quran</h4>
    
    <div class="box box-science">
        <p><strong>The first example: The effect of listening to the Quran on the intensity of pain after open-heart surgery</strong></p>
        <p>A study by Aburuz et al (2023) conducted a randomized controlled trial (RCT) involving 132 patients after coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG) in four hospitals in Amman, Jordan, with the aim of studying the effect of listening to the recitation of the Holy Quran on: Pain intensity, length of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) and length of hospitalization</p>
        <p><strong>Study design and intervention:</strong> The experimental group listened to the Qur'an for 10 minutes twice daily</p>
        <p><strong>What results were obtained?</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Pain relief:</strong> Before the intervention, patients in the Quran group had an average pain of 6.82 on a scale of 0 to 10. After the daily majlis for two days, the pain decreased to an average of 4.65. The difference was statistically significant (t = 23.65 and p < 0.001), meaning the reduction was not by chance</li>
            <li><strong>Shortened length of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU):</strong> Quran group patients spent about 5 days in the ICU, compared to 6.6 days in the control. The difference is significant at p < 0.05, meaning it is clinically and scientifically meaningful</li>
            <li><strong>Reduced length of hospital stay:</strong> The total length of hospitalization was shorter in the Quran-listening group (about 10.2 days) versus 15 days for the control group. The statistical significance was p < 0.05, indicating the effectiveness and appropriateness of the intervention.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>What does this mean for those who don't understand statistical analysis?</strong></p>
        <p>Listening to the Quran helped patients feel less pain after surgery. It shortened their time in one of the most critical areas of the hospital (intensive care), meaning they got better more quickly. They also left the hospital earlier compared to those who did not listen to the recitation. This gives hope and a safe and inexpensive complementary therapy that can be used with regular medical treatment to improve comfort and recovery after surgeries. The control group received standard medical care without any spiritual intervention.</p>

        <p><strong>The second form: A study on the effect of the Qur'an on anxiety and depression</strong></p>
        <p>The effect of reciting and listening to the Qur'an on anxiety, stress, and depression: A Scoping Review: Published in Health Science Reports 2023 by: Khadijeh Moulaei et al.</p>
        <p>(The effect of the holy Quran recitation and listening on anxiety, stress, and depression: A scoping review on outcomes - Health Science Reports (2023)</p>
        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Background and purpose:</strong> Anxiety, stress, and depression are common psychological issues that negatively affect different segments of the population. It has been found that reciting or listening to the Quran can help reduce them. This study aimed to investigate the effect of the Qur'an on these psychological conditions</li>
            <li><strong>Method:</strong> PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases were used. After 174 articles were filtered, only 15 articles were selected according to criteria considered by three researchers, using the PRISMA checklist to report a thorough review</li>
            <li><strong>Results:</strong> The effect of the Qur'an on anxiety was studied in 45% of the studies, stress in 30%, and depression in 25%. The Beck Depression Inventory was the most commonly used scale to assess the effect of recitation or listening on reducing these symptoms. The researchers concluded that it is a non-pharmacological, simple, low-cost and effective treatment method for reducing anxiety, stress and depression.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Based on the results of this study, Quran recitation and listening can be applied as a useful non-pharmacological treatment to reduce levels of anxiety, stress, and depression</p>
    </div>

    <div class="box box-science">
        <p><strong>The third model: A multicenter study on the effect of the Qur'an on preoperative patients</strong></p>
        <p>The effect of Qur'anic recitation in reducing anxiety before elective surgery: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials</p>
        <p>Zarea Gavgani et al. (2020) conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of 12 clinical studies (including 9 randomized trials) on the effect of listening to Quranic recitation on reducing anxiety before elective operations, and found that recitation reduced anxiety levels very significantly, with no publication bias (t = 0.907, P = 0.39), and proved beneficial in both major and minor surgeries.</p>
        <p>The researchers characterized this method as a non-pharmacological and peaceful intervention that is recommended in non-urgent surgical situations.</p>
        <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Quran recitation is a non-pharmacological and peaceful intervention that effectively reduces anxiety before non-urgent surgery</p>
    </div>

    <h4>Possible scientific mechanisms of Qur'anic healing and tasbih</h4>
    <p>Based on previous studies and scientific research, several potential mechanisms can be proposed to explain the effect of Quran and tasbih on health via multiple physiological mechanisms.</p>
    <p>They activate the parasympathetic nervous system to lower stress and heart rate, and modulate levels of hormones such as cortisol to reduce pain and improve mood. These practices also boost immune system functions, alter brain wave patterns towards relaxation, and the sound frequencies of the Quran may have a direct effect on cells and tissues.</p>

    <h4>Sharia and scientific controls for Qur'anic therapy</h4>
    <p>It is important to note that Qur'anic therapy is subject to Sharia and scientific controls, including</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>The Qur'an is not a substitute for medical treatment:</strong> The Qur'an is a complement to treatment, not a substitute for it, and combining Ruqyah with medical treatment is the correct approach, both legally and medically.</li>
        <li><strong>Commitment to the correct Islamic ruqyah:</strong> Limit yourself to what is mentioned in the Qur'an and Sunnah, and avoid heresies and superstitions.</li>
        <li><strong>Avoid quackery and sorcery:</strong> Beware of charlatans who claim to treat with the Qur'an and practice acts that are contrary to the Sharia.</li>
        <li><strong>Scientific humility:</strong> recognizing that studies in this field are still limited and that more rigorous research is needed.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Recommendations and Future Prospects</h4>
    <p>In light of the previous models and studies, the following recommendations can be made:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Conduct more scientific studies:</strong> There is a need to conduct more rigorous scientific studies on the impact of the Qur'an and tasbih on health, using rigorous scientific methodologies.</li>
        <li><strong>Develop integrated treatment programs:</strong> Work to develop treatment programs that combine modern medicine and Quranic therapy, under the supervision of specialists in both fields.</li>
        <li><strong>Training medical staff:</strong> Training doctors and therapists on how to integrate Quranic therapy into the patient's treatment plan, within legal and scientific controls.</li>
        <li><strong>Documentation of healing cases:</strong> Creating a documented database of Quranic healing cases, with accurate medical documentation before and after treatment.</li>
        <li><strong>Community outreach:</strong> Spreading awareness of the legitimate and scientific rules of Qur'anic therapy, and avoiding exaggerations and unsubstantiated claims.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The models and studies presented in this paper indicate that there are potential positive effects of the Qur'an and tasbih on health, which is consistent with the Qur'anic texts about the Qur'an being a healer. However, these effects need further research and rigorous scientific study.</p>

    <h2 id="section7">Section VII: Practical applications in integrative medicine to utilize the power of words and praise</h2>
    <p>Integrative medicine is used to manage a wide range of conditions, such as chronic pain, anxiety, fatigue, nausea, and even to support cancer patients.</p>
    <p>We explore the integration of Islamic spiritual practices, such as Qur'anic recitation, dhikr, and tasbih, within the framework of integrative medicine.</p>
    <p>We will review the basic principles linking these practices to health, review the available scientific evidence supporting their benefits, and emphasize the importance of rigorous research in establishing their place in contemporary healthcare.</p>

    <h3>First: Integrative Medicine Programs Inspired by Prophetic Medicine</h3>
    <p>Prophetic medicine, a set of health guidelines and practices derived from the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad, offers a deep philosophical framework that is compatible with the principles of modern integrative medicine.</p>
    
    <h4>Foundations of Islamic Integrative Medicine</h4>
    <p>The vision of Islamic integrative medicine is based on solid foundations in the Islamic tradition and is consistent with modern trends in holistic medicine:</p>
    
    <p><strong>A holistic view of the human being:</strong></p>
    <p>Prophetic medicine emphasizes the close connection between the health of the body and the soul.</p>
    <div class="box box-quote">
        Ibn al-Qayyim noted in Zad al-Mu'ad, "The medicine of hearts and souls is a great asset in the treatment of bodies."
    </div>
    <p>This saying, which predates the modern recognition of the psychosomatic connection, asserts that spiritual or psychological disorders can negatively affect physical health.</p>
    <p>When I was in medical school, our physiology professor used to scoff at "alternative medicine," considering it to be superstition.</p>
    <p>In the modern healthcare world, there is a growing interest in a holistic approach that sees the human being as an integrated unit of body, mind and spirit.</p>
    <p>This trend has spawned the field of "integrative medicine," which combines conventional medical treatments with evidence-based complementary practices to promote health and overall well-being.</p>
    <p>Contemporary scientific studies support this view, showing complex interactions between psychological states and physiological processes that affect health and behavior.</p>
    <p>For example, chronic stress can weaken immune function and alter heart rate.</p>

    <p><strong>Combine physical and spiritual therapy:</strong></p>
    <p>Prophetic medicine does not contradict modern scientific progress, but rather encourages the use of physical therapy alongside spiritual healing.</p>
    <div class="box box-quran">
        The Prophet's Hadith: " Sunan Abū Dāwūd 3855 (ṣa ḥ ī ḥ – al-Albānī) Narrated Usāmah ibn Sharik al-Kinānī:<br>
        “They asked the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, ‘O Messenger of Allah, should we seek treatment?’ He replied:‘Seek treatment, for Allah has not made a disease without appointing a remedy for it, except old age.’”
    </div>
    <p>It urges seeking and utilizing treatment, while believing that ultimate healing is in God's hands. This integration explains the better response of some patients when spiritual practices are added to conventional medical treatment.</p>

    <p><strong>Prevention before cure:</strong></p>
    <p>Prophetic medicine places great importance on the prevention of disease through a healthy and balanced lifestyle, including moderation in eating and physical activity. These principles are fully compatible with the concept of modern preventive medicine.</p>

    <p><strong>Adapting to the demands of the times:</strong></p>
    <p>Islamic integrative medicine is characterized by its flexibility and its ability to integrate modern technologies to serve the purpose of "self-preservation".</p>

    <h4>Applications and Research Centers in Islamic Integrative Medicine</h4>
    <p>Efforts to incorporate the principles of prophetic medicine into modern health practices are on the rise, with an emphasis on scientific research to document effectiveness.</p>
    <p>Several universities and research centers in the Middle East and beyond are exploring this field.</p>
    
    <p><strong>National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM)</strong></p>
    <p>It is an official Saudi institution established in 2009, headquartered in Riyadh under the direct supervision of the Ministry of Health and is the approved national reference for the regulation of complementary medicine activities in the Kingdom, and issues licenses for practitioners of cupping, chiropractic, acupuncture and others, as well as supervises the conditions of facilities and equipment.</p>
    <p>The center issues regulations, establishes databases, and conducts research and training courses in the field of alternative medicine, with a focus on Islamic and Arabic medicine</p>
    <p>It also establishes research and training partnerships with academic entities such as Imam Mohammed bin Saud Islamic University to promote education and scientific documentation of integrative practices.</p>

    <p><strong>Faculty of Medicine at Al-Azhar University in Cairo</strong></p>
    <p>Since 2018, it has adopted an integrative medical education system that combines basic and clinical sciences within a unified study plan, and encourages self-learning and active participation of the student, with the aim of providing an integrated and comprehensive medical material without repetition, within the framework of a moderate Islamic culture.</p>
    <p>The vice dean emphasized that this system promotes practical understanding of disease from a multidisciplinary perspective and vertical and horizontal information flow between different medical subjects.</p>

    <p><strong>TAIM Model - Arab and Islamic Medicine in Qatar</strong></p>
    <div class="box box-science">
        <p>An ethnographic study of 84 people in Qatar using the TAIM model, confirming the realistic use of practices such as spiritual healing, herbs, and Islamic nutrition alongside contemporary medicine</p>
        <p>Traditional Arabic & Islamic Medicine: Empirical Assessment of a Conceptual Model in Qatar, published in 2017, involved 43 women and 41 men visiting health centers in Doha, speaking in Arabic, English, Hindi, or Urdu, and conducted in-depth interviews to validate the TAIM model</p>
        <p>Results demonstrated empirical support for all components of the model: Participants used medicinal herbs, spiritual therapies, nutritional practices, body-mind techniques, and manual techniques, both individually and in combination.</p>
        <p>Three practices in particular have emerged in popular use: Spiritual healing, herbal therapy, and nutritional practices linking Islamic heritage and traditional medicine.</p>
    </div>
    <p>These organizations represent vital platforms for exploring and developing healthcare models that combine modern medicine with Islamic principles, and preliminary research in this area is showing promising results.</p>

    <h4>Challenges and methodological considerations</h4>
    <p>Despite its promising potential, Islamic integrative medicine faces challenges that need to be systematically addressed to ensure its scientific credibility and widespread acceptance:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>The need for scientific evidence:</strong> Proving the effectiveness of spiritual and traditional practices requires systematic and rigorous scientific research, including randomized controlled trials, to document their results and convince the scientific and medical community.</li>
        <li><strong>Qualification of personnel:</strong> There is an urgent need to qualify doctors who have a deep knowledge of both modern medicine and the Islamic medical heritage, to avoid unqualified practices that may harm patients.</li>
        <li><strong>Ethical and legal standards:</strong> Strict ethical and sharia standards must be established to regulate practices and protect them from exploitation and misinformation.</li>
        <li><strong>Avoid confusing science with superstition:</strong> It is necessary to accurately sort out the scientific and legitimate practices attributed to prophetic medicine, and discard what is unsubstantiated.</li>
        <li><strong>Complement, not substitute:</strong> It must be emphasized that Islamic integrative medicine is a complement to modern medicine, not a substitute for it.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>This approach aims to develop a model that combines the best of modern and prophetic medicine in a scientifically sound methodology that takes into account the specificity and values of Muslim societies and responds to their contemporary health needs.</p>

    <h3>II: Relaxation and meditation techniques inspired by tasbih and dhikr</h3>
    <p>In a world where anxiety and stress are on the rise, relaxation and meditation techniques have become a necessity. Recent scientific studies confirm the effectiveness of these techniques in improving physical and mental health.</p>

    <h4>The scientific basis for meditation and relaxation techniques</h4>
    <p>Research shows that meditation and relaxation practices have positive physiological and psychological effects:</p>
    <div class="box box-science">
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Stress reduction:</strong> Studies show that meditation can reduce levels of cortisol, the body's main stress hormone. For example, the Effects of Mindfulness Meditation on Serum Cortisol of Medical Students study found that mindfulness meditation reduced medical students' blood cortisol levels by approximately 19.8%. (published study, ResearchGate)."</li>
            <li><strong>Boost immunity:</strong> Relaxation practices can affect immune function. Research suggests that people who regularly meditate may show improvements in immune response, including increased activity of natural killer cells (NK cells), a key part of the immune system (Black & Slavich, 2016)."</li>
            <li><strong>Heart Health:</strong> Relaxation techniques contribute to improved cardiovascular health. In this context, a randomized clinical study of a mindfulness-based blood pressure reduction program (MB-BP) showed a mean reduction in systolic blood pressure of 5.9 mm Hg in participants with hypertension (Blomberg et al., 2023)."</li>
            <li><strong>Mental Health:</strong> Meditation techniques significantly alleviate symptoms of depression and anxiety. A comprehensive meta-analysis of mindfulness meditation programs showed that they led to improvements in anxiety with an effect size of 0.38 and in depression with an effect size of 0.30, results comparable to the effectiveness of antidepressants, but without the side effects (Goyal et al., 2014)."</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h4>Islamic-inspired techniques</h4>
    <p>Recent research shows that the practices of dhikr and Quran recitation, which are at the core of Islamic worship, can be effective tools for promoting mental and physical health:</p>
    
    <p><strong>Zikr and tasbih to reduce stress and anxiety:</strong></p>
    <p>Studies show that dhikr (mentioning God) and tasbih (glorifying God) reduce stress and anxiety levels and promote emotional stability.</p>
    <p>Tawakkul reduces anxiety by promoting relinquishment of control and instilling peace of mind, while dhikr promotes emotional stability through the meditative repetition of sacred phrases, which promotes relaxation and reduces stress responses.</p>
    <div class="box box-science">
        In an applied context, a quasi-experimental study showed that religious dhikr can significantly reduce anxiety, depression and stress in families of patients undergoing open heart surgery (Pourgholami et al., 2020)."
    </div>

    <p><strong>Reciting the Quran to relieve pain and anxiety:</strong></p>
    <div class="box box-science">
        <p>Clinical studies have shown that listening to the recitation of the Quran can significantly reduce pain and anxiety levels.</p>
        <p>"For example, a study found that listening to the Quran reduced pain levels and heart rate in patients receiving mechanical ventilation support (Rababa & Al-Hammouri, 2025).</p>
        <p>Another study showed that the sound of the Quran led to a 53.5% decrease in anxiety level in patients before neurosurgery (Abdolahi et al., 2018)."</p>
    </div>

    <p><strong>Merging authenticity and innovation:</strong></p>
    <p>How do we make heritage contemporary? The goal is not a literal return to the past, but rather to draw on the spirit and intent of heritage to develop contemporary techniques. Specialized psychiatric centers are working to integrate traditional techniques inspired by tasbih and dhikr with modern scientific methods:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Integrating tasbih with cognitive-behavioral therapy:</strong> Tasbih can be used as a means of reprogramming and modifying negative thoughts, taking advantage of its repetitive and focused nature.</li>
        <li><strong>Integrating dhikr with mindfulness:</strong> Zikr can be used as a focal point for practicing mindfulness in an Islamic spirit. This approach aims to develop an Islamic model of mindfulness, based on tasbih, dhikr, and tikkun, while utilizing modern scientific techniques to measure and enhance its impact on mental and physical health.</li>
        <li><strong>Tasbih with Biofeedback:</strong> Devices can be used to measure heart, brain, and breathing activity during tasbeeh, helping to adjust the tasbeeh method for maximum physiological benefit.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Third: Technological applications to promote healing with the Qur'an and tasbih</h3>
    <p>In the digital age, technology has become a powerful tool that can be used to enhance Islamic spiritual practices and make them more accessible and integrated into daily life.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Digital apps for Quran and dhikr</strong></p>
    <p>There are many digital apps that aim to facilitate the practice of Quran recitation and dhikr, and some incorporate features aimed at promoting psychological and spiritual well-being:</p>
    
    <p><strong>Quran recitation apps:</strong></p>
    <p>There are apps that offer selected recitations of Quranic verses, with the ability to listen to them in a quiet environment.</p>
    <p>General research supports that listening to Quranic recitation can reduce pain, improve sleep quality, and reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety.</p>
    <p>These apps provide an easily accessible way to capitalize on these spiritual and psychological benefits.</p>

    <p><strong>Smart tasbih apps:</strong></p>
    <p>Some tasbeeh apps go beyond digital counters to offer a complete ecosystem. These apps include features such as a comprehensive database of dhikr, a smart reminder system, sensory feedback (such as vibration with each tasbeeh), synchronized breathing, and analytics of your praise pattern.</p>
    <p>Although there are no peer-reviewed scientific studies that directly evaluate the effectiveness of these specific apps in improving mental health, general research confirms that the practice of dhikr and tasbih can reduce stress and anxiety and promote inner calm. These apps aim to facilitate these practices in daily life.</p>

    <p><strong>Research into Islamic digital technologies for mental health</strong></p>
    <p>Research interest in developing therapeutic Islamic digital apps to promote mindfulness and psychological well-being is growing, especially among young Muslims.</p>
    <p>This research aims to integrate evidence-based psychological therapies, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), with traditional Islamic teachings and practices.</p>
    <p>This emerging field seeks to provide culturally sensitive and technology-enabled mental health solutions.</p>
    <p>While general research shows promising benefits of practices such as Quranic recitation, remembrance, and meditation in reducing stress and anxiety and improving well-being, more systematic and rigorous clinical studies are urgently needed to assess the specific effectiveness of Islamic-inspired programs and applications.</p>
    <p>The challenge lies in bridging the gap between traditional wisdom and modern scientific evidence. By investing in high-quality research, training specialized personnel, and establishing clear ethical and legal standards, we can ensure that Islamic integrative medicine effectively and safely contributes to the health and well-being of individuals and societies in the modern era. This path requires ongoing collaboration between religious scholars, clinicians, researchers, and developers to translate this vision into a tangible, evidence-based reality.</p>

    <h4>Challenges and ethical and legal considerations</h4>
    <p>Despite my fascination with these apps, critical consciousness makes me think about the challenges and concerns they raise.</p>
    <p>Some nights, I sit on my balcony and ponder: are we moving in the right direction, or are we forcing technology into spaces that should remain free from digital intrusion?</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>The sanctity of the Quran:</strong> One day, I showed a Quranic app to a very religious friend who looked at me disapprovingly and said, "How can you put God's words on a device with inappropriate songs and clips?" Yes, there is a fundamental question: does the design of these apps respect the sanctity of the Quran? Do they treat it as a sacred text or as mere audio/visual content?</li>
        <li><strong>Accuracy and originality:</strong> Once upon a time, I discovered an error in the text of a hadith in a popular app! When I researched, I found that the app sometimes adopts weak hadiths or dhikr that have no authenticity. This is very dangerous! The average user trusts the app and considers it a reliable source of religious knowledge. It is the developers' duty to verify every word and assign the review to specialized scholars. Some apps have annoyed me by using Quranic verses with sound effects or music backgrounds. This may be crossing the legal boundaries and minimizing the prestige of the Qur'anic text.</li>
        <li><strong>Excessive commercialization:</strong> I was surprised to find out that a dhikr app requires a monthly subscription to access "premium dhikr"! These are free dhikr and prayers, found in books and online, so how can we turn them into a commercialized commodity? I understand the developers' need for profit, but there should be a balance between the commercial aspect and the spiritual message.</li>
        <li><strong>Privacy and data security:</strong> I noticed that some spiritual apps ask for full access to the microphone, location, contacts, and even sensitive data such as heart rate and physical activity. This raises legitimate concerns: Where does this data go? How is it used? Can it be sold to others?</li>
        <li><strong>Fatwa and Sharia oversight:</strong> Most of these apps are not subject to any Sharia oversight from an accredited body. I thought: How many Islamic applications have been submitted to specialized fatwa committees? Who determines what is acceptable and what is excessive? Is there an ethical code that governs the development of these applications?</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Fourth: Acoustic pollution and tasbih: A Positive Alternative to Contemporary Noise</h3>
    <p>I recall a report I came across, issued by the World Health Organization (WHO), which confirms that sound pollution affects more than one billion people around the world! It causes serious health issues, ranging from hearing loss, sleep disorders and hypertension, to chronic stress and poor concentration (World Health Organization, 2024).</p>
    <p>But-amidst the hustle and bustle of modern life, I found a wonderful audio alternative in our Islamic heritage: Tasbih, Dhikr and the Holy Quran. Isn't it a strange paradox? We suffer from sounds that harm us, and we have sounds that heal us!</p>

    <h4>The negative effects of noise pollution - the shock of numbers and facts</h4>
    <p>I admit that I used to underestimate the impact of noise on my health, until I started researching the topic in depth. What I found was shocking:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Physiological effects:</strong> I read an important study in Environmental Health Perspectives The study showed that continuous exposure to environmental noise, even during sleep, leads to a continuous release of stress hormones such as cortisol and adrenaline, explaining the effect of noise on increased blood pressure and acute and chronic stress (Münzel et al., 2018)</li>
        <li><strong>Psychological effects:</strong> Evidence has shown that psychological noise annoyance is associated with increased symptoms of anxiety and depression. A systematic review and analysis of 13 studies found that people with severe environmental noise annoyance had 1.23 times higher rates of depression and 55% higher risk of anxiety, suggesting a statistically significant relationship between noise annoyance and mental health (Gong et al., 2022).</li>
        <li><strong>Cognitive effects:</strong> The study in Psychological Science particularly caught my attention, finding that children who attend schools near airports or highways show poorer performance on tests of memory and concentration (Clark et al., 2017).</li>
        <li><strong>Sleep disorders:</strong> The World Health Organization report was clear: Nighttime noise, even at moderate levels, causes sleep difficulties, interrupts deep sleep, and affects sleep quality. (WHO, 2018)</li>
    </ol>
    <p>When I visited my friend in the village away from the city, I slept an entire night without waking up - for the first time in months! The only difference was the absolute silence.</p>
    <p>I remember a day when I moved to live near a highway. At first, I "got used" to the noise, but later I noticed a slight increase in my blood pressure, despite my healthy lifestyle. Was it the noise? It makes sense now.</p>

    <h4>Tasbih and Quran as a positive vocal alternative - between personal experience and scientific research</h4>
    <p>What really surprised me was discovering that positive sound substitution has existed in our heritage for centuries! This is not an emotional claim, but a fact confirmed by modern science</p>

    <p><strong>Practical initiatives to replace auditory pollution with tasbih and Quran</strong></p>
    <p>"Positive Acoustic Spaces" initiative</p>
    <p>The idea is simple but genius: Transform public spaces from sources of acoustic pollution into oases of sonic tranquility. The initiative includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Replacing loud music in malls with quiet recitations of the Quran - especially during peak times when crowds are at their heaviest.</li>
        <li>"Serenity corners" in public parks, equipped with small loudspeakers that broadcast tasbeehs and dhikr in a soft voice. These corners have become a destination for those who want to meditate and rest amidst the hustle and bustle of the city.</li>
        <li>Designing acoustic spaces in some hospitals, based on "sound therapy", especially in waiting rooms and hospital corridors</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>V: Toward a better utilization of tasbih and Quran in contemporary life</h3>
    <p>I have presented various practical applications - from integrative medicine programs to relaxation techniques, from technological applications to positive sound alternatives. But these are just the tip of the iceberg of possibilities!</p>
    <p>As I sit on my balcony right now, watching the setting sun and listening to the sounds of the bustling city in the distance, deep questions come to mind: Have we really invested in this spiritual and therapeutic wealth inherent in tasbih and the Qur'an? Are we employing it optimally in our complex and fast-paced lives?</p>

    <h4>Recommendations from my experience and reflections</h4>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Integration between science and faith:</strong> I propose the establishment of specialized research centers that bring together religious and empirical scientists to study the effects of praise and the Qur'an with accurate scientific methodologies, while respecting the spiritual and faith dimension.</li>
        <li><strong>Investing in technology:</strong> Technology is a double-edged sword, but we can channel it to serve the soul. I call for the creation of specialized technical tools to develop applications and tools that exploit the Qur'an and tasbih in daily life, while adhering to legal and ethical controls.</li>
        <li><strong>Community outreach:</strong> I regret that many of our youth do not realize the scientific benefits of tasbih and Quran! They see dhikr as just traditional rituals or religious duties. We need to spread awareness of the psychological and physical benefits of these practices, in a modern language that addresses the technology generation.</li>
        <li><strong>Integrate spiritual practices into prevention and treatment programs:</strong> I think it's time to integrate tasbih and Quran as an essential part of medical and psychological protocols in our health institutions, and not just as optional and marginal practices.</li>
        <li><strong>Design positive acoustic environments:</strong> I dream of Islamic cities that replace auditory pollution with positive acoustics! Cities that design their public and private spaces with sonic awareness, and capitalize on the Islamic sonic heritage to improve the quality of life.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>I believe that our spiritual wealth - the Qur'an, tasbih and dhikr - is not only a historical heritage to be proud of, but also a practical solution to the challenges of our time.</p>
    <div class="box box-quote">
        As Ibn al-Qayyim said: "In the Qur'an there is a cure for every ailment, a sufficiency from every affliction, and a riches from everything else."
    </div>
    <p>Will humanity continue to search for peace and tranquility in sophisticated anxiety medications, expensive relaxation applications, and complex meditation sessions, while overlooking a treasure that has existed for fourteen centuries? I hope that this paper will be a step towards a better utilization of this treasure in facing the challenges of modern life</p>

    <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion of Healing Hymns</h2>
    <p>This research provides an integrated vision of the power of words and praise in healing and therapy, from an Islamic scientific perspective. The research has shown that the Qur'an and tasbih are not just linguistic expressions, but a real healing energy that affects the cells of the body and harmonizes with the universe.</p>
    <p>Modern scientific studies have confirmed what the Qur'an and Sunnah indicated fourteen centuries ago, that the Qur'an and tasbih have a healing effect on the body, soul and spirit. Experiments and testimonies have shown the effectiveness of the Qur'an and tasbih in treating many psychological and organic diseases.</p>
    <p>Spiritual medicine in Islam is not a substitute for physical medicine, but rather a complement to it, dealing with the human being as an integrated whole of body, soul and spirit. True healing is achieved when a person is in harmony with the universe, connected to the Creator, and draws healing energy from Him.</p>
    <p>In modern times, the power of words and tasbih can be utilized in integrative medicine programs, relaxation and meditation techniques, and technological applications, combining the authenticity of heritage with modernity, and contributing to achieving healing and balance for the modern person. The Holy Quran remains an eternal miracle, a renewed healing energy, and the words of dhikr and tasbih are a bridge that connects man to the universe and the Creator, and brings him peace, tranquility, and healing. The more science advances, the more it discovers the secrets of these blessed words and their wondrous effect on man and the universe</p>
    <p>I conclude this research with the realization that there is still a long way to go in integrating spiritual medicine with modern medicine. During the preparation of this research, I encountered methodological dilemmas and scientific obstacles, most notably the scarcity of rigorous empirical studies in this field. However, I hope that this research will open the door to further studies that deepen our understanding of the power of words and praise.</p>
